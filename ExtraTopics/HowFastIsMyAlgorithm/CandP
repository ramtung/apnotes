crime and punishment part i chapter i on an exceptionally hot evening early in july a young man came out of the garret in which he lodged in s place and walked slowly as though in hesitation towards k bridge he had successfully avoided meeting his landlady on the staircase his garret was under the roof of a high five storied house and was more like a cupboard than a room the landlady who provided him with garret dinners and attendance lived on the floor below and every time he went out he was obliged to pass her kitchen the door of which invariably stood open and each time he passed the young man had a sick frightened feeling which made him scowl and feel ashamed he was hopelessly in debt to his landlady and was afraid of meeting her this was not because he was cowardly and abject quite the contrary but for some time past he had been in an overstrained irritable condition verging on hypochondria he had become so completely absorbed in himself and isolated from his fellows that he dreaded meeting not only his landlady but anyone at all he was crushed by poverty but the anxieties of his position had of late ceased to weigh upon him he had given up attending to matters of practical importance he had lost all desire to do so nothing that any landlady could do had a real terror for him but to be stopped on the stairs to be forced to listen to her trivial irrelevant gossip to pestering demands for payment threats and complaints and to rack his brains for excuses to prevaricate to lie no rather than that he would creep down the stairs like a cat and slip out unseen this evening however on coming out into the street he became acutely aware of his fears i want to attempt a thing like that and am frightened by these trifles he thought with an odd smile hm yes all is in a man s hands and he lets it all slip from cowardice that s an axiom it would be interesting to know what it is men are most afraid of taking a new step uttering a new word is what they fear most but i am talking too much it s because i chatter that i do nothing or perhaps it is that i chatter because i do nothing i ve learned to chatter this last month lying for days together in my den thinking of jack the giant killer why am i going there now am i capable of that is that serious it is not serious at all it s simply a fantasy to amuse myself a plaything yes maybe it is a plaything the heat in the street was terrible and the airlessness the bustle and the plaster scaffolding bricks and dust all about him and that special petersburg stench so familiar to all who are unable to get out of town in summer all worked painfully upon the young man s already overwrought nerves the insufferable stench from the pot houses which are particularly numerous in that part of the town and the drunken men whom he met continually although it was a working day completed the revolting misery of the picture an expression of the profoundest disgust gleamed for a moment in the young man s refined face he was by the way exceptionally handsome above the average in height slim well built with beautiful dark eyes and dark brown hair soon he sank into deep thought or more accurately speaking into a complete blankness of mind he walked along not observing what was about him and not caring to observe it from time to time he would mutter something from the habit of talking to himself to which he had just confessed at these moments he would become conscious that his ideas were sometimes in a tangle and that he was very weak for two days he had scarcely tasted food he was so badly dressed that even a man accustomed to shabbiness would have been ashamed to be seen in the street in such rags in that quarter of the town however scarcely any shortcoming in dress would have created surprise owing to the proximity of the hay market the number of establishments of bad character the preponderance of the trading and working class population crowded in these streets and alleys in the heart of petersburg types so various were to be seen in the streets that no figure however queer would have caused surprise but there was such accumulated bitterness and contempt in the young man s heart that in spite of all the fastidiousness of youth he minded his rags least of all in the street it was a different matter when he met with acquaintances or with former fellow students whom indeed he disliked meeting at any time and yet when a drunken man who for some unknown reason was being taken somewhere in a huge waggon dragged by a heavy dray horse suddenly shouted at him as he drove past hey there german hatter bawling at the top of his voice and pointing at him the young man stopped suddenly and clutched tremulously at his hat it was a tall round hat from zimmerman s but completely worn out rusty with age all torn and bespattered brimless and bent on one side in a most unseemly fashion not shame however but quite another feeling akin to terror had overtaken him i knew it he muttered in confusion i thought so that s the worst of all why a stupid thing like this the most trivial detail might spoil the whole plan yes my hat is too noticeable it looks absurd and that makes it noticeable with my rags i ought to wear a cap any sort of old pancake but not this grotesque thing nobody wears such a hat it would be noticed a mile off it would be remembered what matters is that people would remember it and that would give them a clue for this business one should be as little conspicuous as possible trifles trifles are what matter why it s just such trifles that always ruin everything he had not far to go he knew indeed how many steps it was from the gate of his lodging house exactly seven hundred and thirty he had counted them once when he had been lost in dreams at the time he had put no faith in those dreams and was only tantalising himself by their hideous but daring recklessness now a month later he had begun to look upon them differently and in spite of the monologues in which he jeered at his own impotence and indecision he had involuntarily come to regard this hideous dream as an exploit to be attempted although he still did not realise this himself he was positively going now for a rehearsal of his project and at every step his excitement grew more and more violent with a sinking heart and a nervous tremor he went up to a huge house which on one side looked on to the canal and on the other into the street this house was let out in tiny tenements and was inhabited by working people of all kinds tailors locksmiths cooks germans of sorts girls picking up a living as best they could petty clerks etc there was a continual coming and going through the two gates and in the two courtyards of the house three or four door keepers were employed on the building the young man was very glad to meet none of them and at once slipped unnoticed through the door on the right and up the staircase it was a back staircase dark and narrow but he was familiar with it already and knew his way and he liked all these surroundings in such darkness even the most inquisitive eyes were not to be dreaded if i am so scared now what would it be if it somehow came to pass that i were really going to do it he could not help asking himself as he reached the fourth storey there his progress was barred by some porters who were engaged in moving furniture out of a flat he knew that the flat had been occupied by a german clerk in the civil service and his family this german was moving out then and so the fourth floor on this staircase would be untenanted except by the old woman that s a good thing anyway he thought to himself as he rang the bell of the old woman s flat the bell gave a faint tinkle as though it were made of tin and not of copper the little flats in such houses always have bells that ring like that he had forgotten the note of that bell and now its peculiar tinkle seemed to remind him of something and to bring it clearly before him he started his nerves were terribly overstrained by now in a little while the door was opened a tiny crack the old woman eyed her visitor with evident distrust through the crack and nothing could be seen but her little eyes glittering in the darkness but seeing a number of people on the landing she grew bolder and opened the door wide the young man stepped into the dark entry which was partitioned off from the tiny kitchen the old woman stood facing him in silence and looking inquiringly at him she was a diminutive withered up old woman of sixty with sharp malignant eyes and a sharp little nose her colourless somewhat grizzled hair was thickly smeared with oil and she wore no kerchief over it round her thin long neck which looked like a hen s leg was knotted some sort of flannel rag and in spite of the heat there hung flapping on her shoulders a mangy fur cape yellow with age the old woman coughed and groaned at every instant the young man must have looked at her with a rather peculiar expression for a gleam of mistrust came into her eyes again raskolnikov a student i came here a month ago the young man made haste to mutter with a half bow remembering that he ought to be more polite i remember my good sir i remember quite well your coming here the old woman said distinctly still keeping her inquiring eyes on his face and here i am again on the same errand raskolnikov continued a little disconcerted and surprised at the old woman s mistrust perhaps she is always like that though only i did not notice it the other time he thought with an uneasy feeling the old woman paused as though hesitating then stepped on one side and pointing to the door of the room she said letting her visitor pass in front of her step in my good sir the little room into which the young man walked with yellow paper on the walls geraniums and muslin curtains in the windows was brightly lighted up at that moment by the setting sun so the sun will shine like this then too flashed as it were by chance through raskolnikov s mind and with a rapid glance he scanned everything in the room trying as far as possible to notice and remember its arrangement but there was nothing special in the room the furniture all very old and of yellow wood consisted of a sofa with a huge bent wooden back an oval table in front of the sofa a dressing table with a looking glass fixed on it between the windows chairs along the walls and two or three half penny prints in yellow frames representing german damsels with birds in their hands that was all in the corner a light was burning before a small ikon everything was very clean the floor and the furniture were brightly polished everything shone lizaveta s work thought the young man there was not a speck of dust to be seen in the whole flat it s in the houses of spiteful old widows that one finds such cleanliness raskolnikov thought again and he stole a curious glance at the cotton curtain over the door leading into another tiny room in which stood the old woman s bed and chest of drawers and into which he had never looked before these two rooms made up the whole flat what do you want the old woman said severely coming into the room and as before standing in front of him so as to look him straight in the face i ve brought something to pawn here and he drew out of his pocket an old fashioned flat silver watch on the back of which was engraved a globe the chain was of steel but the time is up for your last pledge the month was up the day before yesterday i will bring you the interest for another month wait a little but that s for me to do as i please my good sir to wait or to sell your pledge at once how much will you give me for the watch alyona ivanovna you come with such trifles my good sir it s scarcely worth anything i gave you two roubles last time for your ring and one could buy it quite new at a jeweler s for a rouble and a half give me four roubles for it i shall redeem it it was my father s i shall be getting some money soon a rouble and a half and interest in advance if you like a rouble and a half cried the young man please yourself and the old woman handed him back the watch the young man took it and was so angry that he was on the point of going away but checked himself at once remembering that there was nowhere else he could go and that he had had another object also in coming hand it over he said roughly the old woman fumbled in her pocket for her keys and disappeared behind the curtain into the other room the young man left standing alone in the middle of the room listened inquisitively thinking he could hear her unlocking the chest of drawers it must be the top drawer he reflected so she carries the keys in a pocket on the right all in one bunch on a steel ring and there s one key there three times as big as all the others with deep notches that can t be the key of the chest of drawers then there must be some other chest or strong box that s worth knowing strong boxes always have keys like that but how degrading it all is the old woman came back here sir as we say ten copecks the rouble a month so i must take fifteen copecks from a rouble and a half for the month in advance but for the two roubles i lent you before you owe me now twenty copecks on the same reckoning in advance that makes thirty five copecks altogether so i must give you a rouble and fifteen copecks for the watch here it is what only a rouble and fifteen copecks now just so the young man did not dispute it and took the money he looked at the old woman and was in no hurry to get away as though there was still something he wanted to say or to do but he did not himself quite know what i may be bringing you something else in a day or two alyona ivanovna a valuable thing silver a cigarette box as soon as i get it back from a friend he broke off in confusion well we will talk about it then sir good bye are you always at home alone your sister is not here with you he asked her as casually as possible as he went out into the passage what business is she of yours my good sir oh nothing particular i simply asked you are too quick good day alyona ivanovna raskolnikov went out in complete confusion this confusion became more and more intense as he went down the stairs he even stopped short two or three times as though suddenly struck by some thought when he was in the street he cried out oh god how loathsome it all is and can i can i possibly no it s nonsense it s rubbish he added resolutely and how could such an atrocious thing come into my head what filthy things my heart is capable of yes filthy above all disgusting loathsome loathsome and for a whole month i ve been but no words no exclamations could express his agitation the feeling of intense repulsion which had begun to oppress and torture his heart while he was on his way to the old woman had by now reached such a pitch and had taken such a definite form that he did not know what to do with himself to escape from his wretchedness he walked along the pavement like a drunken man regardless of the passers by and jostling against them and only came to his senses when he was in the next street looking round he noticed that he was standing close to a tavern which was entered by steps leading from the pavement to the basement at that instant two drunken men came out at the door and abusing and supporting one another they mounted the steps without stopping to think raskolnikov went down the steps at once till that moment he had never been into a tavern but now he felt giddy and was tormented by a burning thirst he longed for a drink of cold beer and attributed his sudden weakness to the want of food he sat down at a sticky little table in a dark and dirty corner ordered some beer and eagerly drank off the first glassful at once he felt easier and his thoughts became clear all that s nonsense he said hopefully and there is nothing in it all to worry about it s simply physical derangement just a glass of beer a piece of dry bread and in one moment the brain is stronger the mind is clearer and the will is firm phew how utterly petty it all is but in spite of this scornful reflection he was by now looking cheerful as though he were suddenly set free from a terrible burden and he gazed round in a friendly way at the people in the room but even at that moment he had a dim foreboding that this happier frame of mind was also not normal there were few people at the time in the tavern besides the two drunken men he had met on the steps a group consisting of about five men and a girl with a concertina had gone out at the same time their departure left the room quiet and rather empty the persons still in the tavern were a man who appeared to be an artisan drunk but not extremely so sitting before a pot of beer and his companion a huge stout man with a grey beard in a short full skirted coat he was very drunk and had dropped asleep on the bench every now and then he began as though in his sleep cracking his fingers with his arms wide apart and the upper part of his body bounding about on the bench while he hummed some meaningless refrain trying to recall some such lines as these his wife a year he fondly loved his wife a a year he fondly loved or suddenly waking up again walking along the crowded row he met the one he used to know but no one shared his enjoyment his silent companion looked with positive hostility and mistrust at all these manifestations there was another man in the room who looked somewhat like a retired government clerk he was sitting apart now and then sipping from his pot and looking round at the company he too appeared to be in some agitation chapter ii raskolnikov was not used to crowds and as we said before he avoided society of every sort more especially of late but now all at once he felt a desire to be with other people something new seemed to be taking place within him and with it he felt a sort of thirst for company he was so weary after a whole month of concentrated wretchedness and gloomy excitement that he longed to rest if only for a moment in some other world whatever it might be and in spite of the filthiness of the surroundings he was glad now to stay in the tavern the master of the establishment was in another room but he frequently came down some steps into the main room his jaunty tarred boots with red turn over tops coming into view each time before the rest of his person he wore a full coat and a horribly greasy black satin waistcoat with no cravat and his whole face seemed smeared with oil like an iron lock at the counter stood a boy of about fourteen and there was another boy somewhat younger who handed whatever was wanted on the counter lay some sliced cucumber some pieces of dried black bread and some fish chopped up small all smelling very bad it was insufferably close and so heavy with the fumes of spirits that five minutes in such an atmosphere might well make a man drunk there are chance meetings with strangers that interest us from the first moment before a word is spoken such was the impression made on raskolnikov by the person sitting a little distance from him who looked like a retired clerk the young man often recalled this impression afterwards and even ascribed it to presentiment he looked repeatedly at the clerk partly no doubt because the latter was staring persistently at him obviously anxious to enter into conversation at the other persons in the room including the tavern keeper the clerk looked as though he were used to their company and weary of it showing a shade of condescending contempt for them as persons of station and culture inferior to his own with whom it would be useless for him to converse he was a man over fifty bald and grizzled of medium height and stoutly built his face bloated from continual drinking was of a yellow even greenish tinge with swollen eyelids out of which keen reddish eyes gleamed like little chinks but there was something very strange in him there was a light in his eyes as though of intense feeling perhaps there were even thought and intelligence but at the same time there was a gleam of something like madness he was wearing an old and hopelessly ragged black dress coat with all its buttons missing except one and that one he had buttoned evidently clinging to this last trace of respectability a crumpled shirt front covered with spots and stains protruded from his canvas waistcoat like a clerk he wore no beard nor moustache but had been so long unshaven that his chin looked like a stiff greyish brush and there was something respectable and like an official about his manner too but he was restless he ruffled up his hair and from time to time let his head drop into his hands dejectedly resting his ragged elbows on the stained and sticky table at last he looked straight at raskolnikov and said loudly and resolutely may i venture honoured sir to engage you in polite conversation forasmuch as though your exterior would not command respect my experience admonishes me that you are a man of education and not accustomed to drinking i have always respected education when in conjunction with genuine sentiments and i am besides a titular counsellor in rank marmeladov such is my name titular counsellor i make bold to inquire have you been in the service no i am studying answered the young man somewhat surprised at the grandiloquent style of the speaker and also at being so directly addressed in spite of the momentary desire he had just been feeling for company of any sort on being actually spoken to he felt immediately his habitual irritable and uneasy aversion for any stranger who approached or attempted to approach him a student then or formerly a student cried the clerk just what i thought i m a man of experience immense experience sir and he tapped his forehead with his fingers in self approval you ve been a student or have attended some learned institution but allow me he got up staggered took up his jug and glass and sat down beside the young man facing him a little sideways he was drunk but spoke fluently and boldly only occasionally losing the thread of his sentences and drawling his words he pounced upon raskolnikov as greedily as though he too had not spoken to a soul for a month honoured sir he began almost with solemnity poverty is not a vice that s a true saying yet i know too that drunkenness is not a virtue and that that s even truer but beggary honoured sir beggary is a vice in poverty you may still retain your innate nobility of soul but in beggary never no one for beggary a man is not chased out of human society with a stick he is swept out with a broom so as to make it as humiliating as possible and quite right too forasmuch as in beggary i am ready to be the first to humiliate myself hence the pot house honoured sir a month ago mr lebeziatnikov gave my wife a beating and my wife is a very different matter from me do you understand allow me to ask you another question out of simple curiosity have you ever spent a night on a hay barge on the neva no i have not happened to answered raskolnikov what do you mean well i ve just come from one and it s the fifth night i ve slept so he filled his glass emptied it and paused bits of hay were in fact clinging to his clothes and sticking to his hair it seemed quite probable that he had not undressed or washed for the last five days his hands particularly were filthy they were fat and red with black nails his conversation seemed to excite a general though languid interest the boys at the counter fell to sniggering the innkeeper came down from the upper room apparently on purpose to listen to the funny fellow and sat down at a little distance yawning lazily but with dignity evidently marmeladov was a familiar figure here and he had most likely acquired his weakness for high flown speeches from the habit of frequently entering into conversation with strangers of all sorts in the tavern this habit develops into a necessity in some drunkards and especially in those who are looked after sharply and kept in order at home hence in the company of other drinkers they try to justify themselves and even if possible obtain consideration funny fellow pronounced the innkeeper and why don t you work why aren t you at your duty if you are in the service why am i not at my duty honoured sir marmeladov went on addressing himself exclusively to raskolnikov as though it had been he who put that question to him why am i not at my duty does not my heart ache to think what a useless worm i am a month ago when mr lebeziatnikov beat my wife with his own hands and i lay drunk didn t i suffer excuse me young man has it ever happened to you hm well to petition hopelessly for a loan yes it has but what do you mean by hopelessly hopelessly in the fullest sense when you know beforehand that you will get nothing by it you know for instance beforehand with positive certainty that this man this most reputable and exemplary citizen will on no consideration give you money and indeed i ask you why should he for he knows of course that i shan t pay it back from compassion but mr lebeziatnikov who keeps up with modern ideas explained the other day that compassion is forbidden nowadays by science itself and that that s what is done now in england where there is political economy why i ask you should he give it to me and yet though i know beforehand that he won t i set off to him and why do you go put in raskolnikov well when one has no one nowhere else one can go for every man must have somewhere to go since there are times when one absolutely must go somewhere when my own daughter first went out with a yellow ticket then i had to go for my daughter has a yellow passport he added in parenthesis looking with a certain uneasiness at the young man no matter sir no matter he went on hurriedly and with apparent composure when both the boys at the counter guffawed and even the innkeeper smiled no matter i am not confounded by the wagging of their heads for everyone knows everything about it already and all that is secret is made open and i accept it all not with contempt but with humility so be it so be it behold the man excuse me young man can you no to put it more strongly and more distinctly not can you but dare you looking upon me assert that i am not a pig the young man did not answer a word well the orator began again stolidly and with even increased dignity after waiting for the laughter in the room to subside well so be it i am a pig but she is a lady i have the semblance of a beast but katerina ivanovna my spouse is a person of education and an officer s daughter granted granted i am a scoundrel but she is a woman of a noble heart full of sentiments refined by education and yet oh if only she felt for me honoured sir honoured sir you know every man ought to have at least one place where people feel for him but katerina ivanovna though she is magnanimous she is unjust and yet although i realise that when she pulls my hair she only does it out of pity for i repeat without being ashamed she pulls my hair young man he declared with redoubled dignity hearing the sniggering again but my god if she would but once but no no it s all in vain and it s no use talking no use talking for more than once my wish did come true and more than once she has felt for me but such is my fate and i am a beast by nature rather assented the innkeeper yawning marmeladov struck his fist resolutely on the table such is my fate do you know sir do you know i have sold her very stockings for drink not her shoes that would be more or less in the order of things but her stockings her stockings i have sold for drink her mohair shawl i sold for drink a present to her long ago her own property not mine and we live in a cold room and she caught cold this winter and has begun coughing and spitting blood too we have three little children and katerina ivanovna is at work from morning till night she is scrubbing and cleaning and washing the children for she s been used to cleanliness from a child but her chest is weak and she has a tendency to consumption and i feel it do you suppose i don t feel it and the more i drink the more i feel it that s why i drink too i try to find sympathy and feeling in drink i drink so that i may suffer twice as much and as though in despair he laid his head down on the table young man he went on raising his head again in your face i seem to read some trouble of mind when you came in i read it and that was why i addressed you at once for in unfolding to you the story of my life i do not wish to make myself a laughing stock before these idle listeners who indeed know all about it already but i am looking for a man of feeling and education know then that my wife was educated in a high class school for the daughters of noblemen and on leaving she danced the shawl dance before the governor and other personages for which she was presented with a gold medal and a certificate of merit the medal well the medal of course was sold long ago hm but the certificate of merit is in her trunk still and not long ago she showed it to our landlady and although she is most continually on bad terms with the landlady yet she wanted to tell someone or other of her past honours and of the happy days that are gone i don t condemn her for it i don t blame her for the one thing left her is recollection of the past and all the rest is dust and ashes yes yes she is a lady of spirit proud and determined she scrubs the floors herself and has nothing but black bread to eat but won t allow herself to be treated with disrespect that s why she would not overlook mr lebeziatnikov s rudeness to her and so when he gave her a beating for it she took to her bed more from the hurt to her feelings than from the blows she was a widow when i married her with three children one smaller than the other she married her first husband an infantry officer for love and ran away with him from her father s house she was exceedingly fond of her husband but he gave way to cards got into trouble and with that he died he used to beat her at the end and although she paid him back of which i have authentic documentary evidence to this day she speaks of him with tears and she throws him up to me and i am glad i am glad that though only in imagination she should think of herself as having once been happy and she was left at his death with three children in a wild and remote district where i happened to be at the time and she was left in such hopeless poverty that although i have seen many ups and downs of all sort i don t feel equal to describing it even her relations had all thrown her off and she was proud too excessively proud and then honoured sir and then i being at the time a widower with a daughter of fourteen left me by my first wife offered her my hand for i could not bear the sight of such suffering you can judge the extremity of her calamities that she a woman of education and culture and distinguished family should have consented to be my wife but she did weeping and sobbing and wringing her hands she married me for she had nowhere to turn do you understand sir do you understand what it means when you have absolutely nowhere to turn no that you don t understand yet and for a whole year i performed my duties conscientiously and faithfully and did not touch this he tapped the jug with his finger for i have feelings but even so i could not please her and then i lost my place too and that through no fault of mine but through changes in the office and then i did touch it it will be a year and a half ago soon since we found ourselves at last after many wanderings and numerous calamities in this magnificent capital adorned with innumerable monuments here i obtained a situation i obtained it and i lost it again do you understand this time it was through my own fault i lost it for my weakness had come out we have now part of a room at amalia fyodorovna lippevechsel s and what we live upon and what we pay our rent with i could not say there are a lot of people living there besides ourselves dirt and disorder a perfect bedlam hm yes and meanwhile my daughter by my first wife has grown up and what my daughter has had to put up with from her step mother whilst she was growing up i won t speak of for though katerina ivanovna is full of generous feelings she is a spirited lady irritable and short tempered yes but it s no use going over that sonia as you may well fancy has had no education i did make an effort four years ago to give her a course of geography and universal history but as i was not very well up in those subjects myself and we had no suitable books and what books we had hm anyway we have not even those now so all our instruction came to an end we stopped at cyrus of persia since she has attained years of maturity she has read other books of romantic tendency and of late she had read with great interest a book she got through mr lebeziatnikov lewes physiology do you know it and even recounted extracts from it to us and that s the whole of her education and now may i venture to address you honoured sir on my own account with a private question do you suppose that a respectable poor girl can earn much by honest work not fifteen farthings a day can she earn if she is respectable and has no special talent and that without putting her work down for an instant and what s more ivan ivanitch klopstock the civil counsellor have you heard of him has not to this day paid her for the half dozen linen shirts she made him and drove her roughly away stamping and reviling her on the pretext that the shirt collars were not made like the pattern and were put in askew and there are the little ones hungry and katerina ivanovna walking up and down and wringing her hands her cheeks flushed red as they always are in that disease here you live with us says she you eat and drink and are kept warm and you do nothing to help and much she gets to eat and drink when there is not a crust for the little ones for three days i was lying at the time well what of it i was lying drunk and i heard my sonia speaking she is a gentle creature with a soft little voice fair hair and such a pale thin little face she said katerina ivanovna am i really to do a thing like that and darya frantsovna a woman of evil character and very well known to the police had two or three times tried to get at her through the landlady and why not said katerina ivanovna with a jeer you are something mighty precious to be so careful of but don t blame her don t blame her honoured sir don t blame her she was not herself when she spoke but driven to distraction by her illness and the crying of the hungry children and it was said more to wound her than anything else for that s katerina ivanovna s character and when children cry even from hunger she falls to beating them at once at six o clock i saw sonia get up put on her kerchief and her cape and go out of the room and about nine o clock she came back she walked straight up to katerina ivanovna and she laid thirty roubles on the table before her in silence she did not utter a word she did not even look at her she simply picked up our big green drap de dames shawl we have a shawl made of drap de dames put it over her head and face and lay down on the bed with her face to the wall only her little shoulders and her body kept shuddering and i went on lying there just as before and then i saw young man i saw katerina ivanovna in the same silence go up to sonia s little bed she was on her knees all the evening kissing sonia s feet and would not get up and then they both fell asleep in each other s arms together together yes and i lay drunk marmeladov stopped short as though his voice had failed him then he hurriedly filled his glass drank and cleared his throat since then sir he went on after a brief pause since then owing to an unfortunate occurrence and through information given by evil intentioned persons in all which darya frantsovna took a leading part on the pretext that she had been treated with want of respect since then my daughter sofya semyonovna has been forced to take a yellow ticket and owing to that she is unable to go on living with us for our landlady amalia fyodorovna would not hear of it though she had backed up darya frantsovna before and mr lebeziatnikov too hm all the trouble between him and katerina ivanovna was on sonia s account at first he was for making up to sonia himself and then all of a sudden he stood on his dignity how said he can a highly educated man like me live in the same rooms with a girl like that and katerina ivanovna would not let it pass she stood up for her and so that s how it happened and sonia comes to us now mostly after dark she comforts katerina ivanovna and gives her all she can she has a room at the kapernaumovs the tailors she lodges with them kapernaumov is a lame man with a cleft palate and all of his numerous family have cleft palates too and his wife too has a cleft palate they all live in one room but sonia has her own partitioned off hm yes very poor people and all with cleft palates yes then i got up in the morning and put on my rags lifted up my hands to heaven and set off to his excellency ivan afanasyvitch his excellency ivan afanasyvitch do you know him no well then it s a man of god you don t know he is wax wax before the face of the lord even as wax melteth his eyes were dim when he heard my story marmeladov once already you have deceived my expectations i ll take you once more on my own responsibility that s what he said remember he said and now you can go i kissed the dust at his feet in thought only for in reality he would not have allowed me to do it being a statesman and a man of modern political and enlightened ideas i returned home and when i announced that i d been taken back into the service and should receive a salary heavens what a to do there was marmeladov stopped again in violent excitement at that moment a whole party of revellers already drunk came in from the street and the sounds of a hired concertina and the cracked piping voice of a child of seven singing the hamlet were heard in the entry the room was filled with noise the tavern keeper and the boys were busy with the new comers marmeladov paying no attention to the new arrivals continued his story he appeared by now to be extremely weak but as he became more and more drunk he became more and more talkative the recollection of his recent success in getting the situation seemed to revive him and was positively reflected in a sort of radiance on his face raskolnikov listened attentively that was five weeks ago sir yes as soon as katerina ivanovna and sonia heard of it mercy on us it was as though i stepped into the kingdom of heaven it used to be you can lie like a beast nothing but abuse now they were walking on tiptoe hushing the children semyon zaharovitch is tired with his work at the office he is resting shh they made me coffee before i went to work and boiled cream for me they began to get real cream for me do you hear that and how they managed to get together the money for a decent outfit eleven roubles fifty copecks i can t guess boots cotton shirt fronts most magnificent a uniform they got up all in splendid style for eleven roubles and a half the first morning i came back from the office i found katerina ivanovna had cooked two courses for dinner soup and salt meat with horse radish which we had never dreamed of till then she had not any dresses none at all but she got herself up as though she were going on a visit and not that she d anything to do it with she smartened herself up with nothing at all she d done her hair nicely put on a clean collar of some sort cuffs and there she was quite a different person she was younger and better looking sonia my little darling had only helped with money for the time she said it won t do for me to come and see you too often after dark maybe when no one can see do you hear do you hear i lay down for a nap after dinner and what do you think though katerina ivanovna had quarrelled to the last degree with our landlady amalia fyodorovna only a week before she could not resist then asking her in to coffee for two hours they were sitting whispering together semyon zaharovitch is in the service again now and receiving a salary says she and he went himself to his excellency and his excellency himself came out to him made all the others wait and led semyon zaharovitch by the hand before everybody into his study do you hear do you hear to be sure says he semyon zaharovitch remembering your past services says he and in spite of your propensity to that foolish weakness since you promise now and since moreover we ve got on badly without you do you hear do you hear and so says he i rely now on your word as a gentleman and all that let me tell you she has simply made up for herself and not simply out of wantonness for the sake of bragging no she believes it all herself she amuses herself with her own fancies upon my word she does and i don t blame her for it no i don t blame her six days ago when i brought her my first earnings in full twenty three roubles forty copecks altogether she called me her poppet poppet said she my little poppet and when we were by ourselves you understand you would not think me a beauty you would not think much of me as a husband would you well she pinched my cheek my little poppet said she marmeladov broke off tried to smile but suddenly his chin began to twitch he controlled himself however the tavern the degraded appearance of the man the five nights in the hay barge and the pot of spirits and yet this poignant love for his wife and children bewildered his listener raskolnikov listened intently but with a sick sensation he felt vexed that he had come here honoured sir honoured sir cried marmeladov recovering himself oh sir perhaps all this seems a laughing matter to you as it does to others and perhaps i am only worrying you with the stupidity of all the trivial details of my home life but it is not a laughing matter to me for i can feel it all and the whole of that heavenly day of my life and the whole of that evening i passed in fleeting dreams of how i would arrange it all and how i would dress all the children and how i should give her rest and how i should rescue my own daughter from dishonour and restore her to the bosom of her family and a great deal more quite excusable sir well then sir marmeladov suddenly gave a sort of start raised his head and gazed intently at his listener well on the very next day after all those dreams that is to say exactly five days ago in the evening by a cunning trick like a thief in the night i stole from katerina ivanovna the key of her box took out what was left of my earnings how much it was i have forgotten and now look at me all of you it s the fifth day since i left home and they are looking for me there and it s the end of my employment and my uniform is lying in a tavern on the egyptian bridge i exchanged it for the garments i have on and it s the end of everything marmeladov struck his forehead with his fist clenched his teeth closed his eyes and leaned heavily with his elbow on the table but a minute later his face suddenly changed and with a certain assumed slyness and affectation of bravado he glanced at raskolnikov laughed and said this morning i went to see sonia i went to ask her for a pick me up he he he you don t say she gave it to you cried one of the new comers he shouted the words and went off into a guffaw this very quart was bought with her money marmeladov declared addressing himself exclusively to raskolnikov thirty copecks she gave me with her own hands her last all she had as i saw she said nothing she only looked at me without a word not on earth but up yonder they grieve over men they weep but they don t blame them they don t blame them but it hurts more it hurts more when they don t blame thirty copecks yes and maybe she needs them now eh what do you think my dear sir for now she s got to keep up her appearance it costs money that smartness that special smartness you know do you understand and there s pomatum too you see she must have things petticoats starched ones shoes too real jaunty ones to show off her foot when she has to step over a puddle do you understand sir do you understand what all that smartness means and here i her own father here i took thirty copecks of that money for a drink and i am drinking it and i have already drunk it come who will have pity on a man like me eh are you sorry for me sir or not tell me sir are you sorry or not he he he he would have filled his glass but there was no drink left the pot was empty what are you to be pitied for shouted the tavern keeper who was again near them shouts of laughter and even oaths followed the laughter and the oaths came from those who were listening and also from those who had heard nothing but were simply looking at the figure of the discharged government clerk to be pitied why am i to be pitied marmeladov suddenly declaimed standing up with his arm outstretched as though he had been only waiting for that question why am i to be pitied you say yes there s nothing to pity me for i ought to be crucified crucified on a cross not pitied crucify me oh judge crucify me but pity me and then i will go of myself to be crucified for it s not merry making i seek but tears and tribulation do you suppose you that sell that this pint of yours has been sweet to me it was tribulation i sought at the bottom of it tears and tribulation and have found it and i have tasted it but he will pity us who has had pity on all men who has understood all men and all things he is the one he too is the judge he will come in that day and he will ask where is the daughter who gave herself for her cross consumptive step mother and for the little children of another where is the daughter who had pity upon the filthy drunkard her earthly father undismayed by his beastliness and he will say come to me i have already forgiven thee once i have forgiven thee once thy sins which are many are forgiven thee for thou hast loved much and he will forgive my sonia he will forgive i know it i felt it in my heart when i was with her just now and he will judge and will forgive all the good and the evil the wise and the meek and when he has done with all of them then he will summon us you too come forth he will say come forth ye drunkards come forth ye weak ones come forth ye children of shame and we shall all come forth without shame and shall stand before him and he will say unto us ye are swine made in the image of the beast and with his mark but come ye also and the wise ones and those of understanding will say oh lord why dost thou receive these men and he will say this is why i receive them oh ye wise this is why i receive them oh ye of understanding that not one of them believed himself to be worthy of this and he will hold out his hands to us and we shall fall down before him and we shall weep and we shall understand all things then we shall understand all and all will understand katerina ivanovna even she will understand lord thy kingdom come and he sank down on the bench exhausted and helpless looking at no one apparently oblivious of his surroundings and plunged in deep thought his words had created a certain impression there was a moment of silence but soon laughter and oaths were heard again that s his notion talked himself silly a fine clerk he is and so on and so on let us go sir said marmeladov all at once raising his head and addressing raskolnikov come along with me kozel s house looking into the yard i m going to katerina ivanovna time i did raskolnikov had for some time been wanting to go and he had meant to help him marmeladov was much unsteadier on his legs than in his speech and leaned heavily on the young man they had two or three hundred paces to go the drunken man was more and more overcome by dismay and confusion as they drew nearer the house it s not katerina ivanovna i am afraid of now he muttered in agitation and that she will begin pulling my hair what does my hair matter bother my hair that s what i say indeed it will be better if she does begin pulling it that s not what i am afraid of it s her eyes i am afraid of yes her eyes the red on her cheeks too frightens me and her breathing too have you noticed how people in that disease breathe when they are excited i am frightened of the children s crying too for if sonia has not taken them food i don t know what s happened i don t know but blows i am not afraid of know sir that such blows are not a pain to me but even an enjoyment in fact i can t get on without it it s better so let her strike me it relieves her heart it s better so there is the house the house of kozel the cabinet maker a german well to do lead the way they went in from the yard and up to the fourth storey the staircase got darker and darker as they went up it was nearly eleven o clock and although in summer in petersburg there is no real night yet it was quite dark at the top of the stairs a grimy little door at the very top of the stairs stood ajar a very poor looking room about ten paces long was lighted up by a candle end the whole of it was visible from the entrance it was all in disorder littered up with rags of all sorts especially children s garments across the furthest corner was stretched a ragged sheet behind it probably was the bed there was nothing in the room except two chairs and a sofa covered with american leather full of holes before which stood an old deal kitchen table unpainted and uncovered at the edge of the table stood a smoldering tallow candle in an iron candlestick it appeared that the family had a room to themselves not part of a room but their room was practically a passage the door leading to the other rooms or rather cupboards into which amalia lippevechsel s flat was divided stood half open and there was shouting uproar and laughter within people seemed to be playing cards and drinking tea there words of the most unceremonious kind flew out from time to time raskolnikov recognised katerina ivanovna at once she was a rather tall slim and graceful woman terribly emaciated with magnificent dark brown hair and with a hectic flush in her cheeks she was pacing up and down in her little room pressing her hands against her chest her lips were parched and her breathing came in nervous broken gasps her eyes glittered as in fever and looked about with a harsh immovable stare and that consumptive and excited face with the last flickering light of the candle end playing upon it made a sickening impression she seemed to raskolnikov about thirty years old and was certainly a strange wife for marmeladov she had not heard them and did not notice them coming in she seemed to be lost in thought hearing and seeing nothing the room was close but she had not opened the window a stench rose from the staircase but the door on to the stairs was not closed from the inner rooms clouds of tobacco smoke floated in she kept coughing but did not close the door the youngest child a girl of six was asleep sitting curled up on the floor with her head on the sofa a boy a year older stood crying and shaking in the corner probably he had just had a beating beside him stood a girl of nine years old tall and thin wearing a thin and ragged chemise with an ancient cashmere pelisse flung over her bare shoulders long outgrown and barely reaching her knees her arm as thin as a stick was round her brother s neck she was trying to comfort him whispering something to him and doing all she could to keep him from whimpering again at the same time her large dark eyes which looked larger still from the thinness of her frightened face were watching her mother with alarm marmeladov did not enter the door but dropped on his knees in the very doorway pushing raskolnikov in front of him the woman seeing a stranger stopped indifferently facing him coming to herself for a moment and apparently wondering what he had come for but evidently she decided that he was going into the next room as he had to pass through hers to get there taking no further notice of him she walked towards the outer door to close it and uttered a sudden scream on seeing her husband on his knees in the doorway ah she cried out in a frenzy he has come back the criminal the monster and where is the money what s in your pocket show me and your clothes are all different where are your clothes where is the money speak and she fell to searching him marmeladov submissively and obediently held up both arms to facilitate the search not a farthing was there where is the money she cried mercy on us can he have drunk it all there were twelve silver roubles left in the chest and in a fury she seized him by the hair and dragged him into the room marmeladov seconded her efforts by meekly crawling along on his knees and this is a consolation to me this does not hurt me but is a positive con so la tion ho nou red sir he called out shaken to and fro by his hair and even once striking the ground with his forehead the child asleep on the floor woke up and began to cry the boy in the corner losing all control began trembling and screaming and rushed to his sister in violent terror almost in a fit the eldest girl was shaking like a leaf he s drunk it he s drunk it all the poor woman screamed in despair and his clothes are gone and they are hungry hungry and wringing her hands she pointed to the children oh accursed life and you are you not ashamed she pounced all at once upon raskolnikov from the tavern have you been drinking with him you have been drinking with him too go away the young man was hastening away without uttering a word the inner door was thrown wide open and inquisitive faces were peering in at it coarse laughing faces with pipes and cigarettes and heads wearing caps thrust themselves in at the doorway further in could be seen figures in dressing gowns flung open in costumes of unseemly scantiness some of them with cards in their hands they were particularly diverted when marmeladov dragged about by his hair shouted that it was a consolation to him they even began to come into the room at last a sinister shrill outcry was heard this came from amalia lippevechsel herself pushing her way amongst them and trying to restore order after her own fashion and for the hundredth time to frighten the poor woman by ordering her with coarse abuse to clear out of the room next day as he went out raskolnikov had time to put his hand into his pocket to snatch up the coppers he had received in exchange for his rouble in the tavern and to lay them unnoticed on the window afterwards on the stairs he changed his mind and would have gone back what a stupid thing i ve done he thought to himself they have sonia and i want it myself but reflecting that it would be impossible to take it back now and that in any case he would not have taken it he dismissed it with a wave of his hand and went back to his lodging sonia wants pomatum too he said as he walked along the street and he laughed malignantly such smartness costs money hm and maybe sonia herself will be bankrupt to day for there is always a risk hunting big game digging for gold then they would all be without a crust to morrow except for my money hurrah for sonia what a mine they ve dug there and they re making the most of it yes they are making the most of it they ve wept over it and grown used to it man grows used to everything the scoundrel he sank into thought and what if i am wrong he cried suddenly after a moment s thought what if man is not really a scoundrel man in general i mean the whole race of mankind then all the rest is prejudice simply artificial terrors and there are no barriers and it s all as it should be chapter iii he waked up late next day after a broken sleep but his sleep had not refreshed him he waked up bilious irritable ill tempered and looked with hatred at his room it was a tiny cupboard of a room about six paces in length it had a poverty stricken appearance with its dusty yellow paper peeling off the walls and it was so low pitched that a man of more than average height was ill at ease in it and felt every moment that he would knock his head against the ceiling the furniture was in keeping with the room there were three old chairs rather rickety a painted table in the corner on which lay a few manuscripts and books the dust that lay thick upon them showed that they had been long untouched a big clumsy sofa occupied almost the whole of one wall and half the floor space of the room it was once covered with chintz but was now in rags and served raskolnikov as a bed often he went to sleep on it as he was without undressing without sheets wrapped in his old student s overcoat with his head on one little pillow under which he heaped up all the linen he had clean and dirty by way of a bolster a little table stood in front of the sofa it would have been difficult to sink to a lower ebb of disorder but to raskolnikov in his present state of mind this was positively agreeable he had got completely away from everyone like a tortoise in its shell and even the sight of a servant girl who had to wait upon him and looked sometimes into his room made him writhe with nervous irritation he was in the condition that overtakes some monomaniacs entirely concentrated upon one thing his landlady had for the last fortnight given up sending him in meals and he had not yet thought of expostulating with her though he went without his dinner nastasya the cook and only servant was rather pleased at the lodger s mood and had entirely given up sweeping and doing his room only once a week or so she would stray into his room with a broom she waked him up that day get up why are you asleep she called to him it s past nine i have brought you some tea will you have a cup i should think you re fairly starving raskolnikov opened his eyes started and recognised nastasya from the landlady eh he asked slowly and with a sickly face sitting up on the sofa from the landlady indeed she set before him her own cracked teapot full of weak and stale tea and laid two yellow lumps of sugar by the side of it here nastasya take it please he said fumbling in his pocket for he had slept in his clothes and taking out a handful of coppers run and buy me a loaf and get me a little sausage the cheapest at the pork butcher s the loaf i ll fetch you this very minute but wouldn t you rather have some cabbage soup instead of sausage it s capital soup yesterday s i saved it for you yesterday but you came in late it s fine soup when the soup had been brought and he had begun upon it nastasya sat down beside him on the sofa and began chatting she was a country peasant woman and a very talkative one praskovya pavlovna means to complain to the police about you she said he scowled to the police what does she want you don t pay her money and you won t turn out of the room that s what she wants to be sure the devil that s the last straw he muttered grinding his teeth no that would not suit me just now she is a fool he added aloud i ll go and talk to her to day fool she is and no mistake just as i am but why if you are so clever do you lie here like a sack and have nothing to show for it one time you used to go out you say to teach children but why is it you do nothing now i am doing raskolnikov began sullenly and reluctantly what are you doing work what sort of work i am thinking he answered seriously after a pause nastasya was overcome with a fit of laughter she was given to laughter and when anything amused her she laughed inaudibly quivering and shaking all over till she felt ill and have you made much money by your thinking she managed to articulate at last one can t go out to give lessons without boots and i m sick of it don t quarrel with your bread and butter they pay so little for lessons what s the use of a few coppers he answered reluctantly as though replying to his own thought and you want to get a fortune all at once he looked at her strangely yes i want a fortune he answered firmly after a brief pause don t be in such a hurry you quite frighten me shall i get you the loaf or not as you please ah i forgot a letter came for you yesterday when you were out a letter for me from whom i can t say i gave three copecks of my own to the postman for it will you pay me back then bring it to me for god s sake bring it cried raskolnikov greatly excited good god a minute later the letter was brought him that was it from his mother from the province of r he turned pale when he took it it was a long while since he had received a letter but another feeling also suddenly stabbed his heart nastasya leave me alone for goodness sake here are your three copecks but for goodness sake make haste and go the letter was quivering in his hand he did not want to open it in her presence he wanted to be left alone with this letter when nastasya had gone out he lifted it quickly to his lips and kissed it then he gazed intently at the address the small sloping handwriting so dear and familiar of the mother who had once taught him to read and write he delayed he seemed almost afraid of something at last he opened it it was a thick heavy letter weighing over two ounces two large sheets of note paper were covered with very small handwriting my dear rodya wrote his mother it s two months since i last had a talk with you by letter which has distressed me and even kept me awake at night thinking but i am sure you will not blame me for my inevitable silence you know how i love you you are all we have to look to dounia and i you are our all our one hope our one stay what a grief it was to me when i heard that you had given up the university some months ago for want of means to keep yourself and that you had lost your lessons and your other work how could i help you out of my hundred and twenty roubles a year pension the fifteen roubles i sent you four months ago i borrowed as you know on security of my pension from vassily ivanovitch vahrushin a merchant of this town he is a kind hearted man and was a friend of your father s too but having given him the right to receive the pension i had to wait till the debt was paid off and that is only just done so that i ve been unable to send you anything all this time but now thank god i believe i shall be able to send you something more and in fact we may congratulate ourselves on our good fortune now of which i hasten to inform you in the first place would you have guessed dear rodya that your sister has been living with me for the last six weeks and we shall not be separated in the future thank god her sufferings are over but i will tell you everything in order so that you may know just how everything has happened and all that we have hitherto concealed from you when you wrote to me two months ago that you had heard that dounia had a great deal to put up with in the svidrigrailovs house when you wrote that and asked me to tell you all about it what could i write in answer to you if i had written the whole truth to you i dare say you would have thrown up everything and have come to us even if you had to walk all the way for i know your character and your feelings and you would not let your sister be insulted i was in despair myself but what could i do and besides i did not know the whole truth myself then what made it all so difficult was that dounia received a hundred roubles in advance when she took the place as governess in their family on condition of part of her salary being deducted every month and so it was impossible to throw up the situation without repaying the debt this sum now i can explain it all to you my precious rodya she took chiefly in order to send you sixty roubles which you needed so terribly then and which you received from us last year we deceived you then writing that this money came from dounia s savings but that was not so and now i tell you all about it because thank god things have suddenly changed for the better and that you may know how dounia loves you and what a heart she has at first indeed mr svidrigailov treated her very rudely and used to make disrespectful and jeering remarks at table but i don t want to go into all those painful details so as not to worry you for nothing when it is now all over in short in spite of the kind and generous behaviour of marfa petrovna mr svidrigailov s wife and all the rest of the household dounia had a very hard time especially when mr svidrigailov relapsing into his old regimental habits was under the influence of bacchus and how do you think it was all explained later on would you believe that the crazy fellow had conceived a passion for dounia from the beginning but had concealed it under a show of rudeness and contempt possibly he was ashamed and horrified himself at his own flighty hopes considering his years and his being the father of a family and that made him angry with dounia and possibly too he hoped by his rude and sneering behaviour to hide the truth from others but at last he lost all control and had the face to make dounia an open and shameful proposal promising her all sorts of inducements and offering besides to throw up everything and take her to another estate of his or even abroad you can imagine all she went through to leave her situation at once was impossible not only on account of the money debt but also to spare the feelings of marfa petrovna whose suspicions would have been aroused and then dounia would have been the cause of a rupture in the family and it would have meant a terrible scandal for dounia too that would have been inevitable there were various other reasons owing to which dounia could not hope to escape from that awful house for another six weeks you know dounia of course you know how clever she is and what a strong will she has dounia can endure a great deal and even in the most difficult cases she has the fortitude to maintain her firmness she did not even write to me about everything for fear of upsetting me although we were constantly in communication it all ended very unexpectedly marfa petrovna accidentally overheard her husband imploring dounia in the garden and putting quite a wrong interpretation on the position threw the blame upon her believing her to be the cause of it all an awful scene took place between them on the spot in the garden marfa petrovna went so far as to strike dounia refused to hear anything and was shouting at her for a whole hour and then gave orders that dounia should be packed off at once to me in a plain peasant s cart into which they flung all her things her linen and her clothes all pell mell without folding it up and packing it and a heavy shower of rain came on too and dounia insulted and put to shame had to drive with a peasant in an open cart all the seventeen versts into town only think now what answer could i have sent to the letter i received from you two months ago and what could i have written i was in despair i dared not write to you the truth because you would have been very unhappy mortified and indignant and yet what could you do you could only perhaps ruin yourself and besides dounia would not allow it and fill up my letter with trifles when my heart was so full of sorrow i could not for a whole month the town was full of gossip about this scandal and it came to such a pass that dounia and i dared not even go to church on account of the contemptuous looks whispers and even remarks made aloud about us all our acquaintances avoided us nobody even bowed to us in the street and i learnt that some shopmen and clerks were intending to insult us in a shameful way smearing the gates of our house with pitch so that the landlord began to tell us we must leave all this was set going by marfa petrovna who managed to slander dounia and throw dirt at her in every family she knows everyone in the neighbourhood and that month she was continually coming into the town and as she is rather talkative and fond of gossiping about her family affairs and particularly of complaining to all and each of her husband which is not at all right so in a short time she had spread her story not only in the town but over the whole surrounding district it made me ill but dounia bore it better than i did and if only you could have seen how she endured it all and tried to comfort me and cheer me up she is an angel but by god s mercy our sufferings were cut short mr svidrigailov returned to his senses and repented and probably feeling sorry for dounia he laid before marfa petrovna a complete and unmistakable proof of dounia s innocence in the form of a letter dounia had been forced to write and give to him before marfa petrovna came upon them in the garden this letter which remained in mr svidrigailov s hands after her departure she had written to refuse personal explanations and secret interviews for which he was entreating her in that letter she reproached him with great heat and indignation for the baseness of his behaviour in regard to marfa petrovna reminding him that he was the father and head of a family and telling him how infamous it was of him to torment and make unhappy a defenceless girl unhappy enough already indeed dear rodya the letter was so nobly and touchingly written that i sobbed when i read it and to this day i cannot read it without tears moreover the evidence of the servants too cleared dounia s reputation they had seen and known a great deal more than mr svidrigailov had himself supposed as indeed is always the case with servants marfa petrovna was completely taken aback and again crushed as she said herself to us but she was completely convinced of dounia s innocence the very next day being sunday she went straight to the cathedral knelt down and prayed with tears to our lady to give her strength to bear this new trial and to do her duty then she came straight from the cathedral to us told us the whole story wept bitterly and fully penitent she embraced dounia and besought her to forgive her the same morning without any delay she went round to all the houses in the town and everywhere shedding tears she asserted in the most flattering terms dounia s innocence and the nobility of her feelings and her behavior what was more she showed and read to everyone the letter in dounia s own handwriting to mr svidrigailov and even allowed them to take copies of it which i must say i think was superfluous in this way she was busy for several days in driving about the whole town because some people had taken offence through precedence having been given to others and therefore they had to take turns so that in every house she was expected before she arrived and everyone knew that on such and such a day marfa petrovna would be reading the letter in such and such a place and people assembled for every reading of it even many who had heard it several times already both in their own houses and in other people s in my opinion a great deal a very great deal of all this was unnecessary but that s marfa petrovna s character anyway she succeeded in completely re establishing dounia s reputation and the whole ignominy of this affair rested as an indelible disgrace upon her husband as the only person to blame so that i really began to feel sorry for him it was really treating the crazy fellow too harshly dounia was at once asked to give lessons in several families but she refused all of a sudden everyone began to treat her with marked respect and all this did much to bring about the event by which one may say our whole fortunes are now transformed you must know dear rodya that dounia has a suitor and that she has already consented to marry him i hasten to tell you all about the matter and though it has been arranged without asking your consent i think you will not be aggrieved with me or with your sister on that account for you will see that we could not wait and put off our decision till we heard from you and you could not have judged all the facts without being on the spot this was how it happened he is already of the rank of a counsellor pyotr petrovitch luzhin and is distantly related to marfa petrovna who has been very active in bringing the match about it began with his expressing through her his desire to make our acquaintance he was properly received drank coffee with us and the very next day he sent us a letter in which he very courteously made an offer and begged for a speedy and decided answer he is a very busy man and is in a great hurry to get to petersburg so that every moment is precious to him at first of course we were greatly surprised as it had all happened so quickly and unexpectedly we thought and talked it over the whole day he is a well to do man to be depended upon he has two posts in the government and has already made his fortune it is true that he is forty five years old but he is of a fairly prepossessing appearance and might still be thought attractive by women and he is altogether a very respectable and presentable man only he seems a little morose and somewhat conceited but possibly that may only be the impression he makes at first sight and beware dear rodya when he comes to petersburg as he shortly will do beware of judging him too hastily and severely as your way is if there is anything you do not like in him at first sight i give you this warning although i feel sure that he will make a favourable impression upon you moreover in order to understand any man one must be deliberate and careful to avoid forming prejudices and mistaken ideas which are very difficult to correct and get over afterwards and pyotr petrovitch judging by many indications is a thoroughly estimable man at his first visit indeed he told us that he was a practical man but still he shares as he expressed it many of the convictions of our most rising generation and he is an opponent of all prejudices he said a good deal more for he seems a little conceited and likes to be listened to but this is scarcely a vice i of course understood very little of it but dounia explained to me that though he is not a man of great education he is clever and seems to be good natured you know your sister s character rodya she is a resolute sensible patient and generous girl but she has a passionate heart as i know very well of course there is no great love either on his side or on hers but dounia is a clever girl and has the heart of an angel and will make it her duty to make her husband happy who on his side will make her happiness his care of that we have no good reason to doubt though it must be admitted the matter has been arranged in great haste besides he is a man of great prudence and he will see to be sure of himself that his own happiness will be the more secure the happier dounia is with him and as for some defects of character for some habits and even certain differences of opinion which indeed are inevitable even in the happiest marriages dounia has said that as regards all that she relies on herself that there is nothing to be uneasy about and that she is ready to put up with a great deal if only their future relationship can be an honourable and straightforward one he struck me for instance at first as rather abrupt but that may well come from his being an outspoken man and that is no doubt how it is for instance at his second visit after he had received dounia s consent in the course of conversation he declared that before making dounia s acquaintance he had made up his mind to marry a girl of good reputation without dowry and above all one who had experienced poverty because as he explained a man ought not to be indebted to his wife but that it is better for a wife to look upon her husband as her benefactor i must add that he expressed it more nicely and politely than i have done for i have forgotten his actual phrases and only remember the meaning and besides it was obviously not said of design but slipped out in the heat of conversation so that he tried afterwards to correct himself and smooth it over but all the same it did strike me as somewhat rude and i said so afterwards to dounia but dounia was vexed and answered that words are not deeds and that of course is perfectly true dounia did not sleep all night before she made up her mind and thinking that i was asleep she got out of bed and was walking up and down the room all night at last she knelt down before the ikon and prayed long and fervently and in the morning she told me that she had decided i have mentioned already that pyotr petrovitch is just setting off for petersburg where he has a great deal of business and he wants to open a legal bureau he has been occupied for many years in conducting civil and commercial litigation and only the other day he won an important case he has to be in petersburg because he has an important case before the senate so rodya dear he may be of the greatest use to you in every way indeed and dounia and i have agreed that from this very day you could definitely enter upon your career and might consider that your future is marked out and assured for you oh if only this comes to pass this would be such a benefit that we could only look upon it as a providential blessing dounia is dreaming of nothing else we have even ventured already to drop a few words on the subject to pyotr petrovitch he was cautious in his answer and said that of course as he could not get on without a secretary it would be better to be paying a salary to a relation than to a stranger if only the former were fitted for the duties as though there could be doubt of your being fitted but then he expressed doubts whether your studies at the university would leave you time for work at his office the matter dropped for the time but dounia is thinking of nothing else now she has been in a sort of fever for the last few days and has already made a regular plan for your becoming in the end an associate and even a partner in pyotr petrovitch s business which might well be seeing that you are a student of law i am in complete agreement with her rodya and share all her plans and hopes and think there is every probability of realising them and in spite of pyotr petrovitch s evasiveness very natural at present since he does not know you dounia is firmly persuaded that she will gain everything by her good influence over her future husband this she is reckoning upon of course we are careful not to talk of any of these more remote plans to pyotr petrovitch especially of your becoming his partner he is a practical man and might take this very coldly it might all seem to him simply a day dream nor has either dounia or i breathed a word to him of the great hopes we have of his helping us to pay for your university studies we have not spoken of it in the first place because it will come to pass of itself later on and he will no doubt without wasting words offer to do it of himself as though he could refuse dounia that the more readily since you may by your own efforts become his right hand in the office and receive this assistance not as a charity but as a salary earned by your own work dounia wants to arrange it all like this and i quite agree with her and we have not spoken of our plans for another reason that is because i particularly wanted you to feel on an equal footing when you first meet him when dounia spoke to him with enthusiasm about you he answered that one could never judge of a man without seeing him close for oneself and that he looked forward to forming his own opinion when he makes your acquaintance do you know my precious rodya i think that perhaps for some reasons nothing to do with pyotr petrovitch though simply for my own personal perhaps old womanish fancies i should do better to go on living by myself apart than with them after the wedding i am convinced that he will be generous and delicate enough to invite me and to urge me to remain with my daughter for the future and if he has said nothing about it hitherto it is simply because it has been taken for granted but i shall refuse i have noticed more than once in my life that husbands don t quite get on with their mothers in law and i don t want to be the least bit in anyone s way and for my own sake too would rather be quite independent so long as i have a crust of bread of my own and such children as you and dounia if possible i would settle somewhere near you for the most joyful piece of news dear rodya i have kept for the end of my letter know then my dear boy that we may perhaps be all together in a very short time and may embrace one another again after a separation of almost three years it is settled for certain that dounia and i are to set off for petersburg exactly when i don t know but very very soon possibly in a week it all depends on pyotr petrovitch who will let us know when he has had time to look round him in petersburg to suit his own arrangements he is anxious to have the ceremony as soon as possible even before the fast of our lady if it could be managed or if that is too soon to be ready immediately after oh with what happiness i shall press you to my heart dounia is all excitement at the joyful thought of seeing you she said one day in joke that she would be ready to marry pyotr petrovitch for that alone she is an angel she is not writing anything to you now and has only told me to write that she has so much so much to tell you that she is not going to take up her pen now for a few lines would tell you nothing and it would only mean upsetting herself she bids me send you her love and innumerable kisses but although we shall be meeting so soon perhaps i shall send you as much money as i can in a day or two now that everyone has heard that dounia is to marry pyotr petrovitch my credit has suddenly improved and i know that afanasy ivanovitch will trust me now even to seventy five roubles on the security of my pension so that perhaps i shall be able to send you twenty five or even thirty roubles i would send you more but i am uneasy about our travelling expenses for though pyotr petrovitch has been so kind as to undertake part of the expenses of the journey that is to say he has taken upon himself the conveyance of our bags and big trunk which will be conveyed through some acquaintances of his we must reckon upon some expense on our arrival in petersburg where we can t be left without a halfpenny at least for the first few days but we have calculated it all dounia and i to the last penny and we see that the journey will not cost very much it is only ninety versts from us to the railway and we have come to an agreement with a driver we know so as to be in readiness and from there dounia and i can travel quite comfortably third class so that i may very likely be able to send to you not twenty five but thirty roubles but enough i have covered two sheets already and there is no space left for more our whole history but so many events have happened and now my precious rodya i embrace you and send you a mother s blessing till we meet love dounia your sister rodya love her as she loves you and understand that she loves you beyond everything more than herself she is an angel and you rodya you are everything to us our one hope our one consolation if only you are happy we shall be happy do you still say your prayers rodya and believe in the mercy of our creator and our redeemer i am afraid in my heart that you may have been visited by the new spirit of infidelity that is abroad to day if it is so i pray for you remember dear boy how in your childhood when your father was living you used to lisp your prayers at my knee and how happy we all were in those days good bye till we meet then i embrace you warmly warmly with many kisses yours till death pulcheria raskolnikov almost from the first while he read the letter raskolnikov s face was wet with tears but when he finished it his face was pale and distorted and a bitter wrathful and malignant smile was on his lips he laid his head down on his threadbare dirty pillow and pondered pondered a long time his heart was beating violently and his brain was in a turmoil at last he felt cramped and stifled in the little yellow room that was like a cupboard or a box his eyes and his mind craved for space he took up his hat and went out this time without dread of meeting anyone he had forgotten his dread he turned in the direction of the vassilyevsky ostrov walking along vassilyevsky prospect as though hastening on some business but he walked as his habit was without noticing his way muttering and even speaking aloud to himself to the astonishment of the passers by many of them took him to be drunk chapter iv his mother s letter had been a torture to him but as regards the chief fact in it he had felt not one moment s hesitation even whilst he was reading the letter the essential question was settled and irrevocably settled in his mind never such a marriage while i am alive and mr luzhin be damned the thing is perfectly clear he muttered to himself with a malignant smile anticipating the triumph of his decision no mother no dounia you won t deceive me and then they apologise for not asking my advice and for taking the decision without me i dare say they imagine it is arranged now and can t be broken off but we will see whether it can or not a magnificent excuse pyotr petrovitch is such a busy man that even his wedding has to be in post haste almost by express no dounia i see it all and i know what you want to say to me and i know too what you were thinking about when you walked up and down all night and what your prayers were like before the holy mother of kazan who stands in mother s bedroom bitter is the ascent to golgotha hm so it is finally settled you have determined to marry a sensible business man avdotya romanovna one who has a fortune has already made his fortune that is so much more solid and impressive a man who holds two government posts and who shares the ideas of our most rising generation as mother writes and who seems to be kind as dounia herself observes that seems beats everything and that very dounia for that very seems is marrying him splendid splendid but i should like to know why mother has written to me about our most rising generation simply as a descriptive touch or with the idea of prepossessing me in favour of mr luzhin oh the cunning of them i should like to know one thing more how far they were open with one another that day and night and all this time since was it all put into words or did both understand that they had the same thing at heart and in their minds so that there was no need to speak of it aloud and better not to speak of it most likely it was partly like that from mother s letter it s evident he struck her as rude a little and mother in her simplicity took her observations to dounia and she was sure to be vexed and answered her angrily i should think so who would not be angered when it was quite clear without any naive questions and when it was understood that it was useless to discuss it and why does she write to me love dounia rodya and she loves you more than herself has she a secret conscience prick at sacrificing her daughter to her son you are our one comfort you are everything to us oh mother his bitterness grew more and more intense and if he had happened to meet mr luzhin at the moment he might have murdered him hm yes that s true he continued pursuing the whirling ideas that chased each other in his brain it is true that it needs time and care to get to know a man but there is no mistake about mr luzhin the chief thing is he is a man of business and seems kind that was something wasn t it to send the bags and big box for them a kind man no doubt after that but his bride and her mother are to drive in a peasant s cart covered with sacking i know i have been driven in it no matter it is only ninety versts and then they can travel very comfortably third class for a thousand versts quite right too one must cut one s coat according to one s cloth but what about you mr luzhin she is your bride and you must be aware that her mother has to raise money on her pension for the journey to be sure it s a matter of business a partnership for mutual benefit with equal shares and expenses food and drink provided but pay for your tobacco the business man has got the better of them too the luggage will cost less than their fares and very likely go for nothing how is it that they don t both see all that or is it that they don t want to see and they are pleased pleased and to think that this is only the first blossoming and that the real fruits are to come but what really matters is not the stinginess is not the meanness but the tone of the whole thing for that will be the tone after marriage it s a foretaste of it and mother too why should she be so lavish what will she have by the time she gets to petersburg three silver roubles or two paper ones as she says that old woman hm what does she expect to live upon in petersburg afterwards she has her reasons already for guessing that she could not live with dounia after the marriage even for the first few months the good man has no doubt let slip something on that subject also though mother would deny it i shall refuse says she on whom is she reckoning then is she counting on what is left of her hundred and twenty roubles of pension when afanasy ivanovitch s debt is paid she knits woollen shawls and embroiders cuffs ruining her old eyes and all her shawls don t add more than twenty roubles a year to her hundred and twenty i know that so she is building all her hopes all the time on mr luzhin s generosity he will offer it of himself he will press it on me you may wait a long time for that that s how it always is with these schilleresque noble hearts till the last moment every goose is a swan with them till the last moment they hope for the best and will see nothing wrong and although they have an inkling of the other side of the picture yet they won t face the truth till they are forced to the very thought of it makes them shiver they thrust the truth away with both hands until the man they deck out in false colours puts a fool s cap on them with his own hands i should like to know whether mr luzhin has any orders of merit i bet he has the anna in his buttonhole and that he puts it on when he goes to dine with contractors or merchants he will be sure to have it for his wedding too enough of him confound him well mother i don t wonder at it s like her god bless her but how could dounia dounia darling as though i did not know you you were nearly twenty when i saw you last i understood you then mother writes that dounia can put up with a great deal i know that very well i knew that two years and a half ago and for the last two and a half years i have been thinking about it thinking of just that that dounia can put up with a great deal if she could put up with mr svidrigailov and all the rest of it she certainly can put up with a great deal and now mother and she have taken it into their heads that she can put up with mr luzhin who propounds the theory of the superiority of wives raised from destitution and owing everything to their husband s bounty who propounds it too almost at the first interview granted that he let it slip though he is a sensible man yet maybe it was not a slip at all but he meant to make himself clear as soon as possible but dounia dounia she understands the man of course but she will have to live with the man why she d live on black bread and water she would not sell her soul she would not barter her moral freedom for comfort she would not barter it for all schleswig holstein much less mr luzhin s money no dounia was not that sort when i knew her and she is still the same of course yes there s no denying the svidrigailovs are a bitter pill it s a bitter thing to spend one s life a governess in the provinces for two hundred roubles but i know she would rather be a nigger on a plantation or a lett with a german master than degrade her soul and her moral dignity by binding herself for ever to a man whom she does not respect and with whom she has nothing in common for her own advantage and if mr luzhin had been of unalloyed gold or one huge diamond she would never have consented to become his legal concubine why is she consenting then what s the point of it what s the answer it s clear enough for herself for her comfort to save her life she would not sell herself but for someone else she is doing it for one she loves for one she adores she will sell herself that s what it all amounts to for her brother for her mother she will sell herself she will sell everything in such cases we overcome our moral feeling if necessary freedom peace conscience even all all are brought into the market let my life go if only my dear ones may be happy more than that we become casuists we learn to be jesuitical and for a time maybe we can soothe ourselves we can persuade ourselves that it is one s duty for a good object that s just like us it s as clear as daylight it s clear that rodion romanovitch raskolnikov is the central figure in the business and no one else oh yes she can ensure his happiness keep him in the university make him a partner in the office make his whole future secure perhaps he may even be a rich man later on prosperous respected and may even end his life a famous man but my mother it s all rodya precious rodya her first born for such a son who would not sacrifice such a daughter oh loving over partial hearts why for his sake we would not shrink even from sonia s fate sonia sonia marmeladov the eternal victim so long as the world lasts have you taken the measure of your sacrifice both of you is it right can you bear it is it any use is there sense in it and let me tell you dounia sonia s life is no worse than life with mr luzhin there can be no question of love mother writes and what if there can be no respect either if on the contrary there is aversion contempt repulsion what then so you will have to keep up your appearance too is not that so do you understand what that smartness means do you understand that the luzhin smartness is just the same thing as sonia s and may be worse viler baser because in your case dounia it s a bargain for luxuries after all but with sonia it s simply a question of starvation it has to be paid for it has to be paid for dounia this smartness and what if it s more than you can bear afterwards if you regret it the bitterness the misery the curses the tears hidden from all the world for you are not a marfa petrovna and how will your mother feel then even now she is uneasy she is worried but then when she sees it all clearly and i yes indeed what have you taken me for i won t have your sacrifice dounia i won t have it mother it shall not be so long as i am alive it shall not it shall not i won t accept it he suddenly paused in his reflection and stood still it shall not be but what are you going to do to prevent it you ll forbid it and what right have you what can you promise them on your side to give you such a right your whole life your whole future you will devote to them when you have finished your studies and obtained a post yes we have heard all that before and that s all words but now now something must be done now do you understand that and what are you doing now you are living upon them they borrow on their hundred roubles pension they borrow from the svidrigailovs how are you going to save them from svidrigailovs from afanasy ivanovitch vahrushin oh future millionaire zeus who would arrange their lives for them in another ten years in another ten years mother will be blind with knitting shawls maybe with weeping too she will be worn to a shadow with fasting and my sister imagine for a moment what may have become of your sister in ten years what may happen to her during those ten years can you fancy so he tortured himself fretting himself with such questions and finding a kind of enjoyment in it and yet all these questions were not new ones suddenly confronting him they were old familiar aches it was long since they had first begun to grip and rend his heart long long ago his present anguish had its first beginnings it had waxed and gathered strength it had matured and concentrated until it had taken the form of a fearful frenzied and fantastic question which tortured his heart and mind clamouring insistently for an answer now his mother s letter had burst on him like a thunderclap it was clear that he must not now suffer passively worrying himself over unsolved questions but that he must do something do it at once and do it quickly anyway he must decide on something or else or throw up life altogether he cried suddenly in a frenzy accept one s lot humbly as it is once for all and stifle everything in oneself giving up all claim to activity life and love do you understand sir do you understand what it means when you have absolutely nowhere to turn marmeladov s question came suddenly into his mind for every man must have somewhere to turn he gave a sudden start another thought that he had had yesterday slipped back into his mind but he did not start at the thought recurring to him for he knew he had felt beforehand that it must come back he was expecting it besides it was not only yesterday s thought the difference was that a month ago yesterday even the thought was a mere dream but now now it appeared not a dream at all it had taken a new menacing and quite unfamiliar shape and he suddenly became aware of this himself he felt a hammering in his head and there was a darkness before his eyes he looked round hurriedly he was searching for something he wanted to sit down and was looking for a seat he was walking along the k boulevard there was a seat about a hundred paces in front of him he walked towards it as fast he could but on the way he met with a little adventure which absorbed all his attention looking for the seat he had noticed a woman walking some twenty paces in front of him but at first he took no more notice of her than of other objects that crossed his path it had happened to him many times going home not to notice the road by which he was going and he was accustomed to walk like that but there was at first sight something so strange about the woman in front of him that gradually his attention was riveted upon her at first reluctantly and as it were resentfully and then more and more intently he felt a sudden desire to find out what it was that was so strange about the woman in the first place she appeared to be a girl quite young and she was walking in the great heat bareheaded and with no parasol or gloves waving her arms about in an absurd way she had on a dress of some light silky material but put on strangely awry not properly hooked up and torn open at the top of the skirt close to the waist a great piece was rent and hanging loose a little kerchief was flung about her bare throat but lay slanting on one side the girl was walking unsteadily too stumbling and staggering from side to side she drew raskolnikov s whole attention at last he overtook the girl at the seat but on reaching it she dropped down on it in the corner she let her head sink on the back of the seat and closed her eyes apparently in extreme exhaustion looking at her closely he saw at once that she was completely drunk it was a strange and shocking sight he could hardly believe that he was not mistaken he saw before him the face of a quite young fair haired girl sixteen perhaps not more than fifteen years old pretty little face but flushed and heavy looking and as it were swollen the girl seemed hardly to know what she was doing she crossed one leg over the other lifting it indecorously and showed every sign of being unconscious that she was in the street raskolnikov did not sit down but he felt unwilling to leave her and stood facing her in perplexity this boulevard was never much frequented and now at two o clock in the stifling heat it was quite deserted and yet on the further side of the boulevard about fifteen paces away a gentleman was standing on the edge of the pavement he too would apparently have liked to approach the girl with some object of his own he too had probably seen her in the distance and had followed her but found raskolnikov in his way he looked angrily at him though he tried to escape his notice and stood impatiently biding his time till the unwelcome man in rags should have moved away his intentions were unmistakable the gentleman was a plump thickly set man about thirty fashionably dressed with a high colour red lips and moustaches raskolnikov felt furious he had a sudden longing to insult this fat dandy in some way he left the girl for a moment and walked towards the gentleman hey you svidrigailov what do you want here he shouted clenching his fists and laughing spluttering with rage what do you mean the gentleman asked sternly scowling in haughty astonishment get away that s what i mean how dare you you low fellow he raised his cane raskolnikov rushed at him with his fists without reflecting that the stout gentleman was a match for two men like himself but at that instant someone seized him from behind and a police constable stood between them that s enough gentlemen no fighting please in a public place what do you want who are you he asked raskolnikov sternly noticing his rags raskolnikov looked at him intently he had a straight forward sensible soldierly face with grey moustaches and whiskers you are just the man i want raskolnikov cried catching at his arm i am a student raskolnikov you may as well know that too he added addressing the gentleman come along i have something to show you and taking the policeman by the hand he drew him towards the seat look here hopelessly drunk and she has just come down the boulevard there is no telling who and what she is she does not look like a professional it s more likely she has been given drink and deceived somewhere for the first time you understand and they ve put her out into the street like that look at the way her dress is torn and the way it has been put on she has been dressed by somebody she has not dressed herself and dressed by unpractised hands by a man s hands that s evident and now look there i don t know that dandy with whom i was going to fight i see him for the first time but he too has seen her on the road just now drunk not knowing what she is doing and now he is very eager to get hold of her to get her away somewhere while she is in this state that s certain believe me i am not wrong i saw him myself watching her and following her but i prevented him and he is just waiting for me to go away now he has walked away a little and is standing still pretending to make a cigarette think how can we keep her out of his hands and how are we to get her home the policeman saw it all in a flash the stout gentleman was easy to understand he turned to consider the girl the policeman bent over to examine her more closely and his face worked with genuine compassion ah what a pity he said shaking his head why she is quite a child she has been deceived you can see that at once listen lady he began addressing her where do you live the girl opened her weary and sleepy looking eyes gazed blankly at the speaker and waved her hand here said raskolnikov feeling in his pocket and finding twenty copecks here call a cab and tell him to drive her to her address the only thing is to find out her address missy missy the policeman began again taking the money i ll fetch you a cab and take you home myself where shall i take you eh where do you live go away they won t let me alone the girl muttered and once more waved her hand ach ach how shocking it s shameful missy it s a shame he shook his head again shocked sympathetic and indignant it s a difficult job the policeman said to raskolnikov and as he did so he looked him up and down in a rapid glance he too must have seemed a strange figure to him dressed in rags and handing him money did you meet her far from here he asked him i tell you she was walking in front of me staggering just here in the boulevard she only just reached the seat and sank down on it ah the shameful things that are done in the world nowadays god have mercy on us an innocent creature like that drunk already she has been deceived that s a sure thing see how her dress has been torn too ah the vice one sees nowadays and as likely as not she belongs to gentlefolk too poor ones maybe there are many like that nowadays she looks refined too as though she were a lady and he bent over her once more perhaps he had daughters growing up like that looking like ladies and refined with pretensions to gentility and smartness the chief thing is raskolnikov persisted to keep her out of this scoundrel s hands why should he outrage her it s as clear as day what he is after ah the brute he is not moving off raskolnikov spoke aloud and pointed to him the gentleman heard him and seemed about to fly into a rage again but thought better of it and confined himself to a contemptuous look he then walked slowly another ten paces away and again halted keep her out of his hands we can said the constable thoughtfully if only she d tell us where to take her but as it is missy hey missy he bent over her once more she opened her eyes fully all of a sudden looked at him intently as though realising something got up from the seat and walked away in the direction from which she had come oh shameful wretches they won t let me alone she said waving her hand again she walked quickly though staggering as before the dandy followed her but along another avenue keeping his eye on her don t be anxious i won t let him have her the policeman said resolutely and he set off after them ah the vice one sees nowadays he repeated aloud sighing at that moment something seemed to sting raskolnikov in an instant a complete revulsion of feeling came over him hey here he shouted after the policeman the latter turned round let them be what is it to do with you let her go let him amuse himself he pointed at the dandy what is it to do with you the policeman was bewildered and stared at him open eyed raskolnikov laughed well ejaculated the policeman with a gesture of contempt and he walked after the dandy and the girl probably taking raskolnikov for a madman or something even worse he has carried off my twenty copecks raskolnikov murmured angrily when he was left alone well let him take as much from the other fellow to allow him to have the girl and so let it end and why did i want to interfere is it for me to help have i any right to help let them devour each other alive what is to me how did i dare to give him twenty copecks were they mine in spite of those strange words he felt very wretched he sat down on the deserted seat his thoughts strayed aimlessly he found it hard to fix his mind on anything at that moment he longed to forget himself altogether to forget everything and then to wake up and begin life anew poor girl he said looking at the empty corner where she had sat she will come to herself and weep and then her mother will find out she will give her a beating a horrible shameful beating and then maybe turn her out of doors and even if she does not the darya frantsovnas will get wind of it and the girl will soon be slipping out on the sly here and there then there will be the hospital directly that s always the luck of those girls with respectable mothers who go wrong on the sly and then again the hospital drink the taverns and more hospital in two or three years a wreck and her life over at eighteen or nineteen have not i seen cases like that and how have they been brought to it why they ve all come to it like that ugh but what does it matter that s as it should be they tell us a certain percentage they tell us must every year go that way to the devil i suppose so that the rest may remain chaste and not be interfered with a percentage what splendid words they have they are so scientific so consolatory once you ve said percentage there s nothing more to worry about if we had any other word maybe we might feel more uneasy but what if dounia were one of the percentage of another one if not that one but where am i going he thought suddenly strange i came out for something as soon as i had read the letter i came out i was going to vassilyevsky ostrov to razumihin that s what it was now i remember what for though and what put the idea of going to razumihin into my head just now that s curious he wondered at himself razumihin was one of his old comrades at the university it was remarkable that raskolnikov had hardly any friends at the university he kept aloof from everyone went to see no one and did not welcome anyone who came to see him and indeed everyone soon gave him up he took no part in the students gatherings amusements or conversations he worked with great intensity without sparing himself and he was respected for this but no one liked him he was very poor and there was a sort of haughty pride and reserve about him as though he were keeping something to himself he seemed to some of his comrades to look down upon them all as children as though he were superior in development knowledge and convictions as though their beliefs and interests were beneath him with razumihin he had got on or at least he was more unreserved and communicative with him indeed it was impossible to be on any other terms with razumihin he was an exceptionally good humoured and candid youth good natured to the point of simplicity though both depth and dignity lay concealed under that simplicity the better of his comrades understood this and all were fond of him he was extremely intelligent though he was certainly rather a simpleton at times he was of striking appearance tall thin blackhaired and always badly shaved he was sometimes uproarious and was reputed to be of great physical strength one night when out in a festive company he had with one blow laid a gigantic policeman on his back there was no limit to his drinking powers but he could abstain from drink altogether he sometimes went too far in his pranks but he could do without pranks altogether another thing striking about razumihin no failure distressed him and it seemed as though no unfavourable circumstances could crush him he could lodge anywhere and bear the extremes of cold and hunger he was very poor and kept himself entirely on what he could earn by work of one sort or another he knew of no end of resources by which to earn money he spent one whole winter without lighting his stove and used to declare that he liked it better because one slept more soundly in the cold for the present he too had been obliged to give up the university but it was only for a time and he was working with all his might to save enough to return to his studies again raskolnikov had not been to see him for the last four months and razumihin did not even know his address about two months before they had met in the street but raskolnikov had turned away and even crossed to the other side that he might not be observed and though razumihin noticed him he passed him by as he did not want to annoy him chapter v of course i ve been meaning lately to go to razumihin s to ask for work to ask him to get me lessons or something raskolnikov thought but what help can he be to me now suppose he gets me lessons suppose he shares his last farthing with me if he has any farthings so that i could get some boots and make myself tidy enough to give lessons hm well and what then what shall i do with the few coppers i earn that s not what i want now it s really absurd for me to go to razumihin the question why he was now going to razumihin agitated him even more than he was himself aware he kept uneasily seeking for some sinister significance in this apparently ordinary action could i have expected to set it all straight and to find a way out by means of razumihin alone he asked himself in perplexity he pondered and rubbed his forehead and strange to say after long musing suddenly as if it were spontaneously and by chance a fantastic thought came into his head hm to razumihin s he said all at once calmly as though he had reached a final determination i shall go to razumihin s of course but not now i shall go to him on the next day after it when it will be over and everything will begin afresh and suddenly he realised what he was thinking after it he shouted jumping up from the seat but is it really going to happen is it possible it really will happen he left the seat and went off almost at a run he meant to turn back homewards but the thought of going home suddenly filled him with intense loathing in that hole in that awful little cupboard of his all this had for a month past been growing up in him and he walked on at random his nervous shudder had passed into a fever that made him feel shivering in spite of the heat he felt cold with a kind of effort he began almost unconsciously from some inner craving to stare at all the objects before him as though looking for something to distract his attention but he did not succeed and kept dropping every moment into brooding when with a start he lifted his head again and looked round he forgot at once what he had just been thinking about and even where he was going in this way he walked right across vassilyevsky ostrov came out on to the lesser neva crossed the bridge and turned towards the islands the greenness and freshness were at first restful to his weary eyes after the dust of the town and the huge houses that hemmed him in and weighed upon him here there were no taverns no stifling closeness no stench but soon these new pleasant sensations passed into morbid irritability sometimes he stood still before a brightly painted summer villa standing among green foliage he gazed through the fence he saw in the distance smartly dressed women on the verandahs and balconies and children running in the gardens the flowers especially caught his attention he gazed at them longer than at anything he was met too by luxurious carriages and by men and women on horseback he watched them with curious eyes and forgot about them before they had vanished from his sight once he stood still and counted his money he found he had thirty copecks twenty to the policeman three to nastasya for the letter so i must have given forty seven or fifty to the marmeladovs yesterday he thought reckoning it up for some unknown reason but he soon forgot with what object he had taken the money out of his pocket he recalled it on passing an eating house or tavern and felt that he was hungry going into the tavern he drank a glass of vodka and ate a pie of some sort he finished eating it as he walked away it was a long while since he had taken vodka and it had an effect upon him at once though he only drank a wineglassful his legs felt suddenly heavy and a great drowsiness came upon him he turned homewards but reaching petrovsky ostrov he stopped completely exhausted turned off the road into the bushes sank down upon the grass and instantly fell asleep in a morbid condition of the brain dreams often have a singular actuality vividness and extraordinary semblance of reality at times monstrous images are created but the setting and the whole picture are so truthlike and filled with details so delicate so unexpectedly but so artistically consistent that the dreamer were he an artist like pushkin or turgenev even could never have invented them in the waking state such sick dreams always remain long in the memory and make a powerful impression on the overwrought and deranged nervous system raskolnikov had a fearful dream he dreamt he was back in his childhood in the little town of his birth he was a child about seven years old walking into the country with his father on the evening of a holiday it was a grey and heavy day the country was exactly as he remembered it indeed he recalled it far more vividly in his dream than he had done in memory the little town stood on a level flat as bare as the hand not even a willow near it only in the far distance a copse lay a dark blur on the very edge of the horizon a few paces beyond the last market garden stood a tavern a big tavern which had always aroused in him a feeling of aversion even of fear when he walked by it with his father there was always a crowd there always shouting laughter and abuse hideous hoarse singing and often fighting drunken and horrible looking figures were hanging about the tavern he used to cling close to his father trembling all over when he met them near the tavern the road became a dusty track the dust of which was always black it was a winding road and about a hundred paces further on it turned to the right to the graveyard in the middle of the graveyard stood a stone church with a green cupola where he used to go to mass two or three times a year with his father and mother when a service was held in memory of his grandmother who had long been dead and whom he had never seen on these occasions they used to take on a white dish tied up in a table napkin a special sort of rice pudding with raisins stuck in it in the shape of a cross he loved that church the old fashioned unadorned ikons and the old priest with the shaking head near his grandmother s grave which was marked by a stone was the little grave of his younger brother who had died at six months old he did not remember him at all but he had been told about his little brother and whenever he visited the graveyard he used religiously and reverently to cross himself and to bow down and kiss the little grave and now he dreamt that he was walking with his father past the tavern on the way to the graveyard he was holding his father s hand and looking with dread at the tavern a peculiar circumstance attracted his attention there seemed to be some kind of festivity going on there were crowds of gaily dressed townspeople peasant women their husbands and riff raff of all sorts all singing and all more or less drunk near the entrance of the tavern stood a cart but a strange cart it was one of those big carts usually drawn by heavy cart horses and laden with casks of wine or other heavy goods he always liked looking at those great cart horses with their long manes thick legs and slow even pace drawing along a perfect mountain with no appearance of effort as though it were easier going with a load than without it but now strange to say in the shafts of such a cart he saw a thin little sorrel beast one of those peasants nags which he had often seen straining their utmost under a heavy load of wood or hay especially when the wheels were stuck in the mud or in a rut and the peasants would beat them so cruelly sometimes even about the nose and eyes and he felt so sorry so sorry for them that he almost cried and his mother always used to take him away from the window all of a sudden there was a great uproar of shouting singing and the balalaika and from the tavern a number of big and very drunken peasants came out wearing red and blue shirts and coats thrown over their shoulders get in get in shouted one of them a young thick necked peasant with a fleshy face red as a carrot i ll take you all get in but at once there was an outbreak of laughter and exclamations in the crowd take us all with a beast like that why mikolka are you crazy to put a nag like that in such a cart and this mare is twenty if she is a day mates get in i ll take you all mikolka shouted again leaping first into the cart seizing the reins and standing straight up in front the bay has gone with matvey he shouted from the cart and this brute mates is just breaking my heart i feel as if i could kill her she s just eating her head off get in i tell you i ll make her gallop she ll gallop and he picked up the whip preparing himself with relish to flog the little mare get in come along the crowd laughed d you hear she ll gallop gallop indeed she has not had a gallop in her for the last ten years she ll jog along don t you mind her mates bring a whip each of you get ready all right give it to her they all clambered into mikolka s cart laughing and making jokes six men got in and there was still room for more they hauled in a fat rosy cheeked woman she was dressed in red cotton in a pointed beaded headdress and thick leather shoes she was cracking nuts and laughing the crowd round them was laughing too and indeed how could they help laughing that wretched nag was to drag all the cartload of them at a gallop two young fellows in the cart were just getting whips ready to help mikolka with the cry of now the mare tugged with all her might but far from galloping could scarcely move forward she struggled with her legs gasping and shrinking from the blows of the three whips which were showered upon her like hail the laughter in the cart and in the crowd was redoubled but mikolka flew into a rage and furiously thrashed the mare as though he supposed she really could gallop let me get in too mates shouted a young man in the crowd whose appetite was aroused get in all get in cried mikolka she will draw you all i ll beat her to death and he thrashed and thrashed at the mare beside himself with fury father father he cried father what are they doing father they are beating the poor horse come along come along said his father they are drunken and foolish they are in fun come away don t look and he tried to draw him away but he tore himself away from his hand and beside himself with horror ran to the horse the poor beast was in a bad way she was gasping standing still then tugging again and almost falling beat her to death cried mikolka it s come to that i ll do for her what are you about are you a christian you devil shouted an old man in the crowd did anyone ever see the like a wretched nag like that pulling such a cartload said another you ll kill her shouted the third don t meddle it s my property i ll do what i choose get in more of you get in all of you i will have her go at a gallop all at once laughter broke into a roar and covered everything the mare roused by the shower of blows began feebly kicking even the old man could not help smiling to think of a wretched little beast like that trying to kick two lads in the crowd snatched up whips and ran to the mare to beat her about the ribs one ran each side hit her in the face in the eyes in the eyes cried mikolka give us a song mates shouted someone in the cart and everyone in the cart joined in a riotous song jingling a tambourine and whistling the woman went on cracking nuts and laughing he ran beside the mare ran in front of her saw her being whipped across the eyes right in the eyes he was crying he felt choking his tears were streaming one of the men gave him a cut with the whip across the face he did not feel it wringing his hands and screaming he rushed up to the grey headed old man with the grey beard who was shaking his head in disapproval one woman seized him by the hand and would have taken him away but he tore himself from her and ran back to the mare she was almost at the last gasp but began kicking once more i ll teach you to kick mikolka shouted ferociously he threw down the whip bent forward and picked up from the bottom of the cart a long thick shaft he took hold of one end with both hands and with an effort brandished it over the mare he ll crush her was shouted round him he ll kill her it s my property shouted mikolka and brought the shaft down with a swinging blow there was a sound of a heavy thud thrash her thrash her why have you stopped shouted voices in the crowd and mikolka swung the shaft a second time and it fell a second time on the spine of the luckless mare she sank back on her haunches but lurched forward and tugged forward with all her force tugged first on one side and then on the other trying to move the cart but the six whips were attacking her in all directions and the shaft was raised again and fell upon her a third time then a fourth with heavy measured blows mikolka was in a fury that he could not kill her at one blow she s a tough one was shouted in the crowd she ll fall in a minute mates there will soon be an end of her said an admiring spectator in the crowd fetch an axe to her finish her off shouted a third i ll show you stand off mikolka screamed frantically he threw down the shaft stooped down in the cart and picked up an iron crowbar look out he shouted and with all his might he dealt a stunning blow at the poor mare the blow fell the mare staggered sank back tried to pull but the bar fell again with a swinging blow on her back and she fell on the ground like a log finish her off shouted mikolka and he leapt beside himself out of the cart several young men also flushed with drink seized anything they could come across whips sticks poles and ran to the dying mare mikolka stood on one side and began dealing random blows with the crowbar the mare stretched out her head drew a long breath and died you butchered her someone shouted in the crowd why wouldn t she gallop then my property shouted mikolka with bloodshot eyes brandishing the bar in his hands he stood as though regretting that he had nothing more to beat no mistake about it you are not a christian many voices were shouting in the crowd but the poor boy beside himself made his way screaming through the crowd to the sorrel nag put his arms round her bleeding dead head and kissed it kissed the eyes and kissed the lips then he jumped up and flew in a frenzy with his little fists out at mikolka at that instant his father who had been running after him snatched him up and carried him out of the crowd come along come let us go home he said to him father why did they kill the poor horse he sobbed but his voice broke and the words came in shrieks from his panting chest they are drunk they are brutal it s not our business said his father he put his arms round his father but he felt choked choked he tried to draw a breath to cry out and woke up he waked up gasping for breath his hair soaked with perspiration and stood up in terror thank god that was only a dream he said sitting down under a tree and drawing deep breaths but what is it is it some fever coming on such a hideous dream he felt utterly broken darkness and confusion were in his soul he rested his elbows on his knees and leaned his head on his hands good god he cried can it be can it be that i shall really take an axe that i shall strike her on the head split her skull open that i shall tread in the sticky warm blood break the lock steal and tremble hide all spattered in the blood with the axe good god can it be he was shaking like a leaf as he said this but why am i going on like this he continued sitting up again as it were in profound amazement i knew that i could never bring myself to it so what have i been torturing myself for till now yesterday yesterday when i went to make that experiment yesterday i realised completely that i could never bear to do it why am i going over it again then why am i hesitating as i came down the stairs yesterday i said myself that it was base loathsome vile vile the very thought of it made me feel sick and filled me with horror no i couldn t do it i couldn t do it granted granted that there is no flaw in all that reasoning that all that i have concluded this last month is clear as day true as arithmetic my god anyway i couldn t bring myself to it i couldn t do it i couldn t do it why why then am i still he rose to his feet looked round in wonder as though surprised at finding himself in this place and went towards the bridge he was pale his eyes glowed he was exhausted in every limb but he seemed suddenly to breathe more easily he felt he had cast off that fearful burden that had so long been weighing upon him and all at once there was a sense of relief and peace in his soul lord he prayed show me my path i renounce that accursed dream of mine crossing the bridge he gazed quietly and calmly at the neva at the glowing red sun setting in the glowing sky in spite of his weakness he was not conscious of fatigue it was as though an abscess that had been forming for a month past in his heart had suddenly broken freedom freedom he was free from that spell that sorcery that obsession later on when he recalled that time and all that happened to him during those days minute by minute point by point he was superstitiously impressed by one circumstance which though in itself not very exceptional always seemed to him afterwards the predestined turning point of his fate he could never understand and explain to himself why when he was tired and worn out when it would have been more convenient for him to go home by the shortest and most direct way he had returned by the hay market where he had no need to go it was obviously and quite unnecessarily out of his way though not much so it is true that it happened to him dozens of times to return home without noticing what streets he passed through but why he was always asking himself why had such an important such a decisive and at the same time such an absolutely chance meeting happened in the hay market where he had moreover no reason to go at the very hour the very minute of his life when he was just in the very mood and in the very circumstances in which that meeting was able to exert the gravest and most decisive influence on his whole destiny as though it had been lying in wait for him on purpose it was about nine o clock when he crossed the hay market at the tables and the barrows at the booths and the shops all the market people were closing their establishments or clearing away and packing up their wares and like their customers were going home rag pickers and costermongers of all kinds were crowding round the taverns in the dirty and stinking courtyards of the hay market raskolnikov particularly liked this place and the neighbouring alleys when he wandered aimlessly in the streets here his rags did not attract contemptuous attention and one could walk about in any attire without scandalising people at the corner of an alley a huckster and his wife had two tables set out with tapes thread cotton handkerchiefs etc they too had got up to go home but were lingering in conversation with a friend who had just come up to them this friend was lizaveta ivanovna or as everyone called her lizaveta the younger sister of the old pawnbroker alyona ivanovna whom raskolnikov had visited the previous day to pawn his watch and make his experiment he already knew all about lizaveta and she knew him a little too she was a single woman of about thirty five tall clumsy timid submissive and almost idiotic she was a complete slave and went in fear and trembling of her sister who made her work day and night and even beat her she was standing with a bundle before the huckster and his wife listening earnestly and doubtfully they were talking of something with special warmth the moment raskolnikov caught sight of her he was overcome by a strange sensation as it were of intense astonishment though there was nothing astonishing about this meeting you could make up your mind for yourself lizaveta ivanovna the huckster was saying aloud come round to morrow about seven they will be here too to morrow said lizaveta slowly and thoughtfully as though unable to make up her mind upon my word what a fright you are in of alyona ivanovna gabbled the huckster s wife a lively little woman i look at you you are like some little babe and she is not your own sister either nothing but a step sister and what a hand she keeps over you but this time don t say a word to alyona ivanovna her husband interrupted that s my advice but come round to us without asking it will be worth your while later on your sister herself may have a notion am i to come about seven o clock to morrow and they will be here you will be able to decide for yourself and we ll have a cup of tea added his wife all right i ll come said lizaveta still pondering and she began slowly moving away raskolnikov had just passed and heard no more he passed softly unnoticed trying not to miss a word his first amazement was followed by a thrill of horror like a shiver running down his spine he had learnt he had suddenly quite unexpectedly learnt that the next day at seven o clock lizaveta the old woman s sister and only companion would be away from home and that therefore at seven o clock precisely the old woman would be left alone he was only a few steps from his lodging he went in like a man condemned to death he thought of nothing and was incapable of thinking but he felt suddenly in his whole being that he had no more freedom of thought no will and that everything was suddenly and irrevocably decided certainly if he had to wait whole years for a suitable opportunity he could not reckon on a more certain step towards the success of the plan than that which had just presented itself in any case it would have been difficult to find out beforehand and with certainty with greater exactness and less risk and without dangerous inquiries and investigations that next day at a certain time an old woman on whose life an attempt was contemplated would be at home and entirely alone chapter vi later on raskolnikov happened to find out why the huckster and his wife had invited lizaveta it was a very ordinary matter and there was nothing exceptional about it a family who had come to the town and been reduced to poverty were selling their household goods and clothes all women s things as the things would have fetched little in the market they were looking for a dealer this was lizaveta s business she undertook such jobs and was frequently employed as she was very honest and always fixed a fair price and stuck to it she spoke as a rule little and as we have said already she was very submissive and timid but raskolnikov had become superstitious of late the traces of superstition remained in him long after and were almost ineradicable and in all this he was always afterwards disposed to see something strange and mysterious as it were the presence of some peculiar influences and coincidences in the previous winter a student he knew called pokorev who had left for harkov had chanced in conversation to give him the address of alyona ivanovna the old pawnbroker in case he might want to pawn anything for a long while he did not go to her for he had lessons and managed to get along somehow six weeks ago he had remembered the address he had two articles that could be pawned his father s old silver watch and a little gold ring with three red stones a present from his sister at parting he decided to take the ring when he found the old woman he had felt an insurmountable repulsion for her at the first glance though he knew nothing special about her he got two roubles from her and went into a miserable little tavern on his way home he asked for tea sat down and sank into deep thought a strange idea was pecking at his brain like a chicken in the egg and very very much absorbed him almost beside him at the next table there was sitting a student whom he did not know and had never seen and with him a young officer they had played a game of billiards and began drinking tea all at once he heard the student mention to the officer the pawnbroker alyona ivanovna and give him her address this of itself seemed strange to raskolnikov he had just come from her and here at once he heard her name of course it was a chance but he could not shake off a very extraordinary impression and here someone seemed to be speaking expressly for him the student began telling his friend various details about alyona ivanovna she is first rate he said you can always get money from her she is as rich as a jew she can give you five thousand roubles at a time and she is not above taking a pledge for a rouble lots of our fellows have had dealings with her but she is an awful old harpy and he began describing how spiteful and uncertain she was how if you were only a day late with your interest the pledge was lost how she gave a quarter of the value of an article and took five and even seven percent a month on it and so on the student chattered on saying that she had a sister lizaveta whom the wretched little creature was continually beating and kept in complete bondage like a small child though lizaveta was at least six feet high there s a phenomenon for you cried the student and he laughed they began talking about lizaveta the student spoke about her with a peculiar relish and was continually laughing and the officer listened with great interest and asked him to send lizaveta to do some mending for him raskolnikov did not miss a word and learned everything about her lizaveta was younger than the old woman and was her half sister being the child of a different mother she was thirty five she worked day and night for her sister and besides doing the cooking and the washing she did sewing and worked as a charwoman and gave her sister all she earned she did not dare to accept an order or job of any kind without her sister s permission the old woman had already made her will and lizaveta knew of it and by this will she would not get a farthing nothing but the movables chairs and so on all the money was left to a monastery in the province of n that prayers might be said for her in perpetuity lizaveta was of lower rank than her sister unmarried and awfully uncouth in appearance remarkably tall with long feet that looked as if they were bent outwards she always wore battered goatskin shoes and was clean in her person what the student expressed most surprise and amusement about was the fact that lizaveta was continually with child but you say she is hideous observed the officer yes she is so dark skinned and looks like a soldier dressed up but you know she is not at all hideous she has such a good natured face and eyes strikingly so and the proof of it is that lots of people are attracted by her she is such a soft gentle creature ready to put up with anything always willing willing to do anything and her smile is really very sweet you seem to find her attractive yourself laughed the officer from her queerness no i ll tell you what i could kill that damned old woman and make off with her money i assure you without the faintest conscience prick the student added with warmth the officer laughed again while raskolnikov shuddered how strange it was listen i want to ask you a serious question the student said hotly i was joking of course but look here on one side we have a stupid senseless worthless spiteful ailing horrid old woman not simply useless but doing actual mischief who has not an idea what she is living for herself and who will die in a day or two in any case you understand you understand yes yes i understand answered the officer watching his excited companion attentively well listen then on the other side fresh young lives thrown away for want of help and by thousands on every side a hundred thousand good deeds could be done and helped on that old woman s money which will be buried in a monastery hundreds thousands perhaps might be set on the right path dozens of families saved from destitution from ruin from vice from the lock hospitals and all with her money kill her take her money and with the help of it devote oneself to the service of humanity and the good of all what do you think would not one tiny crime be wiped out by thousands of good deeds for one life thousands would be saved from corruption and decay one death and a hundred lives in exchange it s simple arithmetic besides what value has the life of that sickly stupid ill natured old woman in the balance of existence no more than the life of a louse of a black beetle less in fact because the old woman is doing harm she is wearing out the lives of others the other day she bit lizaveta s finger out of spite it almost had to be amputated of course she does not deserve to live remarked the officer but there it is it s nature oh well brother but we have to correct and direct nature and but for that we should drown in an ocean of prejudice but for that there would never have been a single great man they talk of duty conscience i don t want to say anything against duty and conscience but the point is what do we mean by them stay i have another question to ask you listen no you stay i ll ask you a question listen well you are talking and speechifying away but tell me would you kill the old woman yourself of course not i was only arguing the justice of it it s nothing to do with me but i think if you would not do it yourself there s no justice about it let us have another game raskolnikov was violently agitated of course it was all ordinary youthful talk and thought such as he had often heard before in different forms and on different themes but why had he happened to hear such a discussion and such ideas at the very moment when his own brain was just conceiving the very same ideas and why just at the moment when he had brought away the embryo of his idea from the old woman had he dropped at once upon a conversation about her this coincidence always seemed strange to him this trivial talk in a tavern had an immense influence on him in his later action as though there had really been in it something preordained some guiding hint on returning from the hay market he flung himself on the sofa and sat for a whole hour without stirring meanwhile it got dark he had no candle and indeed it did not occur to him to light up he could never recollect whether he had been thinking about anything at that time at last he was conscious of his former fever and shivering and he realised with relief that he could lie down on the sofa soon heavy leaden sleep came over him as it were crushing him he slept an extraordinarily long time and without dreaming nastasya coming into his room at ten o clock the next morning had difficulty in rousing him she brought him in tea and bread the tea was again the second brew and again in her own tea pot my goodness how he sleeps she cried indignantly and he is always asleep he got up with an effort his head ached he stood up took a turn in his garret and sank back on the sofa again going to sleep again cried nastasya are you ill eh he made no reply do you want some tea afterwards he said with an effort closing his eyes again and turning to the wall nastasya stood over him perhaps he really is ill she said turned and went out she came in again at two o clock with soup he was lying as before the tea stood untouched nastasya felt positively offended and began wrathfully rousing him why are you lying like a log she shouted looking at him with repulsion he got up and sat down again but said nothing and stared at the floor are you ill or not asked nastasya and again received no answer you d better go out and get a breath of air she said after a pause will you eat it or not afterwards he said weakly you can go and he motioned her out she remained a little longer looked at him with compassion and went out a few minutes afterwards he raised his eyes and looked for a long while at the tea and the soup then he took the bread took up a spoon and began to eat he ate a little three or four spoonfuls without appetite as it were mechanically his head ached less after his meal he stretched himself on the sofa again but now he could not sleep he lay without stirring with his face in the pillow he was haunted by day dreams and such strange day dreams in one that kept recurring he fancied that he was in africa in egypt in some sort of oasis the caravan was resting the camels were peacefully lying down the palms stood all around in a complete circle all the party were at dinner but he was drinking water from a spring which flowed gurgling close by and it was so cool it was wonderful wonderful blue cold water running among the parti coloured stones and over the clean sand which glistened here and there like gold suddenly he heard a clock strike he started roused himself raised his head looked out of the window and seeing how late it was suddenly jumped up wide awake as though someone had pulled him off the sofa he crept on tiptoe to the door stealthily opened it and began listening on the staircase his heart beat terribly but all was quiet on the stairs as if everyone was asleep it seemed to him strange and monstrous that he could have slept in such forgetfulness from the previous day and had done nothing had prepared nothing yet and meanwhile perhaps it had struck six and his drowsiness and stupefaction were followed by an extraordinary feverish as it were distracted haste but the preparations to be made were few he concentrated all his energies on thinking of everything and forgetting nothing and his heart kept beating and thumping so that he could hardly breathe first he had to make a noose and sew it into his overcoat a work of a moment he rummaged under his pillow and picked out amongst the linen stuffed away under it a worn out old unwashed shirt from its rags he tore a long strip a couple of inches wide and about sixteen inches long he folded this strip in two took off his wide strong summer overcoat of some stout cotton material his only outer garment and began sewing the two ends of the rag on the inside under the left armhole his hands shook as he sewed but he did it successfully so that nothing showed outside when he put the coat on again the needle and thread he had got ready long before and they lay on his table in a piece of paper as for the noose it was a very ingenious device of his own the noose was intended for the axe it was impossible for him to carry the axe through the street in his hands and if hidden under his coat he would still have had to support it with his hand which would have been noticeable now he had only to put the head of the axe in the noose and it would hang quietly under his arm on the inside putting his hand in his coat pocket he could hold the end of the handle all the way so that it did not swing and as the coat was very full a regular sack in fact it could not be seen from outside that he was holding something with the hand that was in the pocket this noose too he had designed a fortnight before when he had finished with this he thrust his hand into a little opening between his sofa and the floor fumbled in the left corner and drew out the pledge which he had got ready long before and hidden there this pledge was however only a smoothly planed piece of wood the size and thickness of a silver cigarette case he picked up this piece of wood in one of his wanderings in a courtyard where there was some sort of a workshop afterwards he had added to the wood a thin smooth piece of iron which he had also picked up at the same time in the street putting the iron which was a little the smaller on the piece of wood he fastened them very firmly crossing and re crossing the thread round them then wrapped them carefully and daintily in clean white paper and tied up the parcel so that it would be very difficult to untie it this was in order to divert the attention of the old woman for a time while she was trying to undo the knot and so to gain a moment the iron strip was added to give weight so that the woman might not guess the first minute that the thing was made of wood all this had been stored by him beforehand under the sofa he had only just got the pledge out when he heard someone suddenly about in the yard it struck six long ago long ago my god he rushed to the door listened caught up his hat and began to descend his thirteen steps cautiously noiselessly like a cat he had still the most important thing to do to steal the axe from the kitchen that the deed must be done with an axe he had decided long ago he had also a pocket pruning knife but he could not rely on the knife and still less on his own strength and so resolved finally on the axe we may note in passing one peculiarity in regard to all the final resolutions taken by him in the matter they had one strange characteristic the more final they were the more hideous and the more absurd they at once became in his eyes in spite of all his agonising inward struggle he never for a single instant all that time could believe in the carrying out of his plans and indeed if it had ever happened that everything to the least point could have been considered and finally settled and no uncertainty of any kind had remained he would it seems have renounced it all as something absurd monstrous and impossible but a whole mass of unsettled points and uncertainties remained as for getting the axe that trifling business cost him no anxiety for nothing could be easier nastasya was continually out of the house especially in the evenings she would run in to the neighbours or to a shop and always left the door ajar it was the one thing the landlady was always scolding her about and so when the time came he would only have to go quietly into the kitchen and to take the axe and an hour later when everything was over go in and put it back again but these were doubtful points supposing he returned an hour later to put it back and nastasya had come back and was on the spot he would of course have to go by and wait till she went out again but supposing she were in the meantime to miss the axe look for it make an outcry that would mean suspicion or at least grounds for suspicion but those were all trifles which he had not even begun to consider and indeed he had no time he was thinking of the chief point and put off trifling details until he could believe in it all but that seemed utterly unattainable so it seemed to himself at least he could not imagine for instance that he would sometime leave off thinking get up and simply go there even his late experiment i e his visit with the object of a final survey of the place was simply an attempt at an experiment far from being the real thing as though one should say come let us go and try it why dream about it and at once he had broken down and had run away cursing in a frenzy with himself meanwhile it would seem as regards the moral question that his analysis was complete his casuistry had become keen as a razor and he could not find rational objections in himself but in the last resort he simply ceased to believe in himself and doggedly slavishly sought arguments in all directions fumbling for them as though someone were forcing and drawing him to it at first long before indeed he had been much occupied with one question why almost all crimes are so badly concealed and so easily detected and why almost all criminals leave such obvious traces he had come gradually to many different and curious conclusions and in his opinion the chief reason lay not so much in the material impossibility of concealing the crime as in the criminal himself almost every criminal is subject to a failure of will and reasoning power by a childish and phenomenal heedlessness at the very instant when prudence and caution are most essential it was his conviction that this eclipse of reason and failure of will power attacked a man like a disease developed gradually and reached its highest point just before the perpetration of the crime continued with equal violence at the moment of the crime and for longer or shorter time after according to the individual case and then passed off like any other disease the question whether the disease gives rise to the crime or whether the crime from its own peculiar nature is always accompanied by something of the nature of disease he did not yet feel able to decide when he reached these conclusions he decided that in his own case there could not be such a morbid reaction that his reason and will would remain unimpaired at the time of carrying out his design for the simple reason that his design was not a crime we will omit all the process by means of which he arrived at this last conclusion we have run too far ahead already we may add only that the practical purely material difficulties of the affair occupied a secondary position in his mind one has but to keep all one s will power and reason to deal with them and they will all be overcome at the time when once one has familiarised oneself with the minutest details of the business but this preparation had never been begun his final decisions were what he came to trust least and when the hour struck it all came to pass quite differently as it were accidentally and unexpectedly one trifling circumstance upset his calculations before he had even left the staircase when he reached the landlady s kitchen the door of which was open as usual he glanced cautiously in to see whether in nastasya s absence the landlady herself was there or if not whether the door to her own room was closed so that she might not peep out when he went in for the axe but what was his amazement when he suddenly saw that nastasya was not only at home in the kitchen but was occupied there taking linen out of a basket and hanging it on a line seeing him she left off hanging the clothes turned to him and stared at him all the time he was passing he turned away his eyes and walked past as though he noticed nothing but it was the end of everything he had not the axe he was overwhelmed what made me think he reflected as he went under the gateway what made me think that she would be sure not to be at home at that moment why why why did i assume this so certainly he was crushed and even humiliated he could have laughed at himself in his anger a dull animal rage boiled within him he stood hesitating in the gateway to go into the street to go a walk for appearance sake was revolting to go back to his room even more revolting and what a chance i have lost for ever he muttered standing aimlessly in the gateway just opposite the porter s little dark room which was also open suddenly he started from the porter s room two paces away from him something shining under the bench to the right caught his eye he looked about him nobody he approached the room on tiptoe went down two steps into it and in a faint voice called the porter yes not at home somewhere near though in the yard for the door is wide open he dashed to the axe it was an axe and pulled it out from under the bench where it lay between two chunks of wood at once before going out he made it fast in the noose he thrust both hands into his pockets and went out of the room no one had noticed him when reason fails the devil helps he thought with a strange grin this chance raised his spirits extraordinarily he walked along quietly and sedately without hurry to avoid awakening suspicion he scarcely looked at the passers by tried to escape looking at their faces at all and to be as little noticeable as possible suddenly he thought of his hat good heavens i had the money the day before yesterday and did not get a cap to wear instead a curse rose from the bottom of his soul glancing out of the corner of his eye into a shop he saw by a clock on the wall that it was ten minutes past seven he had to make haste and at the same time to go someway round so as to approach the house from the other side when he had happened to imagine all this beforehand he had sometimes thought that he would be very much afraid but he was not very much afraid now was not afraid at all indeed his mind was even occupied by irrelevant matters but by nothing for long as he passed the yusupov garden he was deeply absorbed in considering the building of great fountains and of their refreshing effect on the atmosphere in all the squares by degrees he passed to the conviction that if the summer garden were extended to the field of mars and perhaps joined to the garden of the mihailovsky palace it would be a splendid thing and a great benefit to the town then he was interested by the question why in all great towns men are not simply driven by necessity but in some peculiar way inclined to live in those parts of the town where there are no gardens nor fountains where there is most dirt and smell and all sorts of nastiness then his own walks through the hay market came back to his mind and for a moment he waked up to reality what nonsense he thought better think of nothing at all so probably men led to execution clutch mentally at every object that meets them on the way flashed through his mind but simply flashed like lightning he made haste to dismiss this thought and by now he was near here was the house here was the gate suddenly a clock somewhere struck once what can it be half past seven impossible it must be fast luckily for him everything went well again at the gates at that very moment as though expressly for his benefit a huge waggon of hay had just driven in at the gate completely screening him as he passed under the gateway and the waggon had scarcely had time to drive through into the yard before he had slipped in a flash to the right on the other side of the waggon he could hear shouting and quarrelling but no one noticed him and no one met him many windows looking into that huge quadrangular yard were open at that moment but he did not raise his head he had not the strength to the staircase leading to the old woman s room was close by just on the right of the gateway he was already on the stairs drawing a breath pressing his hand against his throbbing heart and once more feeling for the axe and setting it straight he began softly and cautiously ascending the stairs listening every minute but the stairs too were quite deserted all the doors were shut he met no one one flat indeed on the first floor was wide open and painters were at work in it but they did not glance at him he stood still thought a minute and went on of course it would be better if they had not been here but it s two storeys above them and there was the fourth storey here was the door here was the flat opposite the empty one the flat underneath the old woman s was apparently empty also the visiting card nailed on the door had been torn off they had gone away he was out of breath for one instant the thought floated through his mind shall i go back but he made no answer and began listening at the old woman s door a dead silence then he listened again on the staircase listened long and intently then looked about him for the last time pulled himself together drew himself up and once more tried the axe in the noose am i very pale he wondered am i not evidently agitated she is mistrustful had i better wait a little longer till my heart leaves off thumping but his heart did not leave off on the contrary as though to spite him it throbbed more and more violently he could stand it no longer he slowly put out his hand to the bell and rang half a minute later he rang again more loudly no answer to go on ringing was useless and out of place the old woman was of course at home but she was suspicious and alone he had some knowledge of her habits and once more he put his ear to the door either his senses were peculiarly keen which it is difficult to suppose or the sound was really very distinct anyway he suddenly heard something like the cautious touch of a hand on the lock and the rustle of a skirt at the very door someone was standing stealthily close to the lock and just as he was doing on the outside was secretly listening within and seemed to have her ear to the door he moved a little on purpose and muttered something aloud that he might not have the appearance of hiding then rang a third time but quietly soberly and without impatience recalling it afterwards that moment stood out in his mind vividly distinctly for ever he could not make out how he had had such cunning for his mind was as it were clouded at moments and he was almost unconscious of his body an instant later he heard the latch unfastened chapter vii the door was as before opened a tiny crack and again two sharp and suspicious eyes stared at him out of the darkness then raskolnikov lost his head and nearly made a great mistake fearing the old woman would be frightened by their being alone and not hoping that the sight of him would disarm her suspicions he took hold of the door and drew it towards him to prevent the old woman from attempting to shut it again seeing this she did not pull the door back but she did not let go the handle so that he almost dragged her out with it on to the stairs seeing that she was standing in the doorway not allowing him to pass he advanced straight upon her she stepped back in alarm tried to say something but seemed unable to speak and stared with open eyes at him good evening alyona ivanovna he began trying to speak easily but his voice would not obey him it broke and shook i have come i have brought something but we d better come in to the light and leaving her he passed straight into the room uninvited the old woman ran after him her tongue was unloosed good heavens what it is who is it what do you want why alyona ivanovna you know me raskolnikov here i brought you the pledge i promised the other day and he held out the pledge the old woman glanced for a moment at the pledge but at once stared in the eyes of her uninvited visitor she looked intently maliciously and mistrustfully a minute passed he even fancied something like a sneer in her eyes as though she had already guessed everything he felt that he was losing his head that he was almost frightened so frightened that if she were to look like that and not say a word for another half minute he thought he would have run away from her why do you look at me as though you did not know me he said suddenly also with malice take it if you like if not i ll go elsewhere i am in a hurry he had not even thought of saying this but it was suddenly said of itself the old woman recovered herself and her visitor s resolute tone evidently restored her confidence but why my good sir all of a minute what is it she asked looking at the pledge the silver cigarette case i spoke of it last time you know she held out her hand but how pale you are to be sure and your hands are trembling too have you been bathing or what fever he answered abruptly you can t help getting pale if you ve nothing to eat he added with difficulty articulating the words his strength was failing him again but his answer sounded like the truth the old woman took the pledge what is it she asked once more scanning raskolnikov intently and weighing the pledge in her hand a thing cigarette case silver look at it it does not seem somehow like silver how he has wrapped it up trying to untie the string and turning to the window to the light all her windows were shut in spite of the stifling heat she left him altogether for some seconds and stood with her back to him he unbuttoned his coat and freed the axe from the noose but did not yet take it out altogether simply holding it in his right hand under the coat his hands were fearfully weak he felt them every moment growing more numb and more wooden he was afraid he would let the axe slip and fall a sudden giddiness came over him but what has he tied it up like this for the old woman cried with vexation and moved towards him he had not a minute more to lose he pulled the axe quite out swung it with both arms scarcely conscious of himself and almost without effort almost mechanically brought the blunt side down on her head he seemed not to use his own strength in this but as soon as he had once brought the axe down his strength returned to him the old woman was as always bareheaded her thin light hair streaked with grey thickly smeared with grease was plaited in a rat s tail and fastened by a broken horn comb which stood out on the nape of her neck as she was so short the blow fell on the very top of her skull she cried out but very faintly and suddenly sank all of a heap on the floor raising her hands to her head in one hand she still held the pledge then he dealt her another and another blow with the blunt side and on the same spot the blood gushed as from an overturned glass the body fell back he stepped back let it fall and at once bent over her face she was dead her eyes seemed to be starting out of their sockets the brow and the whole face were drawn and contorted convulsively he laid the axe on the ground near the dead body and felt at once in her pocket trying to avoid the streaming body the same right hand pocket from which she had taken the key on his last visit he was in full possession of his faculties free from confusion or giddiness but his hands were still trembling he remembered afterwards that he had been particularly collected and careful trying all the time not to get smeared with blood he pulled out the keys at once they were all as before in one bunch on a steel ring he ran at once into the bedroom with them it was a very small room with a whole shrine of holy images against the other wall stood a big bed very clean and covered with a silk patchwork wadded quilt against a third wall was a chest of drawers strange to say so soon as he began to fit the keys into the chest so soon as he heard their jingling a convulsive shudder passed over him he suddenly felt tempted again to give it all up and go away but that was only for an instant it was too late to go back he positively smiled at himself when suddenly another terrifying idea occurred to his mind he suddenly fancied that the old woman might be still alive and might recover her senses leaving the keys in the chest he ran back to the body snatched up the axe and lifted it once more over the old woman but did not bring it down there was no doubt that she was dead bending down and examining her again more closely he saw clearly that the skull was broken and even battered in on one side he was about to feel it with his finger but drew back his hand and indeed it was evident without that meanwhile there was a perfect pool of blood all at once he noticed a string on her neck he tugged at it but the string was strong and did not snap and besides it was soaked with blood he tried to pull it out from the front of the dress but something held it and prevented its coming in his impatience he raised the axe again to cut the string from above on the body but did not dare and with difficulty smearing his hand and the axe in the blood after two minutes hurried effort he cut the string and took it off without touching the body with the axe he was not mistaken it was a purse on the string were two crosses one of cyprus wood and one of copper and an image in silver filigree and with them a small greasy chamois leather purse with a steel rim and ring the purse was stuffed very full raskolnikov thrust it in his pocket without looking at it flung the crosses on the old woman s body and rushed back into the bedroom this time taking the axe with him he was in terrible haste he snatched the keys and began trying them again but he was unsuccessful they would not fit in the locks it was not so much that his hands were shaking but that he kept making mistakes though he saw for instance that a key was not the right one and would not fit still he tried to put it in suddenly he remembered and realised that the big key with the deep notches which was hanging there with the small keys could not possibly belong to the chest of drawers on his last visit this had struck him but to some strong box and that everything perhaps was hidden in that box he left the chest of drawers and at once felt under the bedstead knowing that old women usually keep boxes under their beds and so it was there was a good sized box under the bed at least a yard in length with an arched lid covered with red leather and studded with steel nails the notched key fitted at once and unlocked it at the top under a white sheet was a coat of red brocade lined with hareskin under it was a silk dress then a shawl and it seemed as though there was nothing below but clothes the first thing he did was to wipe his blood stained hands on the red brocade it s red and on red blood will be less noticeable the thought passed through his mind then he suddenly came to himself good god am i going out of my senses he thought with terror but no sooner did he touch the clothes than a gold watch slipped from under the fur coat he made haste to turn them all over there turned out to be various articles made of gold among the clothes probably all pledges unredeemed or waiting to be redeemed bracelets chains ear rings pins and such things some were in cases others simply wrapped in newspaper carefully and exactly folded and tied round with tape without any delay he began filling up the pockets of his trousers and overcoat without examining or undoing the parcels and cases but he had not time to take many he suddenly heard steps in the room where the old woman lay he stopped short and was still as death but all was quiet so it must have been his fancy all at once he heard distinctly a faint cry as though someone had uttered a low broken moan then again dead silence for a minute or two he sat squatting on his heels by the box and waited holding his breath suddenly he jumped up seized the axe and ran out of the bedroom in the middle of the room stood lizaveta with a big bundle in her arms she was gazing in stupefaction at her murdered sister white as a sheet and seeming not to have the strength to cry out seeing him run out of the bedroom she began faintly quivering all over like a leaf a shudder ran down her face she lifted her hand opened her mouth but still did not scream she began slowly backing away from him into the corner staring intently persistently at him but still uttered no sound as though she could not get breath to scream he rushed at her with the axe her mouth twitched piteously as one sees babies mouths when they begin to be frightened stare intently at what frightens them and are on the point of screaming and this hapless lizaveta was so simple and had been so thoroughly crushed and scared that she did not even raise a hand to guard her face though that was the most necessary and natural action at the moment for the axe was raised over her face she only put up her empty left hand but not to her face slowly holding it out before her as though motioning him away the axe fell with the sharp edge just on the skull and split at one blow all the top of the head she fell heavily at once raskolnikov completely lost his head snatching up her bundle dropped it again and ran into the entry fear gained more and more mastery over him especially after this second quite unexpected murder he longed to run away from the place as fast as possible and if at that moment he had been capable of seeing and reasoning more correctly if he had been able to realise all the difficulties of his position the hopelessness the hideousness and the absurdity of it if he could have understood how many obstacles and perhaps crimes he had still to overcome or to commit to get out of that place and to make his way home it is very possible that he would have flung up everything and would have gone to give himself up and not from fear but from simple horror and loathing of what he had done the feeling of loathing especially surged up within him and grew stronger every minute he would not now have gone to the box or even into the room for anything in the world but a sort of blankness even dreaminess had begun by degrees to take possession of him at moments he forgot himself or rather forgot what was of importance and caught at trifles glancing however into the kitchen and seeing a bucket half full of water on a bench he bethought him of washing his hands and the axe his hands were sticky with blood he dropped the axe with the blade in the water snatched a piece of soap that lay in a broken saucer on the window and began washing his hands in the bucket when they were clean he took out the axe washed the blade and spent a long time about three minutes washing the wood where there were spots of blood rubbing them with soap then he wiped it all with some linen that was hanging to dry on a line in the kitchen and then he was a long while attentively examining the axe at the window there was no trace left on it only the wood was still damp he carefully hung the axe in the noose under his coat then as far as was possible in the dim light in the kitchen he looked over his overcoat his trousers and his boots at the first glance there seemed to be nothing but stains on the boots he wetted the rag and rubbed the boots but he knew he was not looking thoroughly that there might be something quite noticeable that he was overlooking he stood in the middle of the room lost in thought dark agonising ideas rose in his mind the idea that he was mad and that at that moment he was incapable of reasoning of protecting himself that he ought perhaps to be doing something utterly different from what he was now doing good god he muttered i must fly fly and he rushed into the entry but here a shock of terror awaited him such as he had never known before he stood and gazed and could not believe his eyes the door the outer door from the stairs at which he had not long before waited and rung was standing unfastened and at least six inches open no lock no bolt all the time all that time the old woman had not shut it after him perhaps as a precaution but good god why he had seen lizaveta afterwards and how could he how could he have failed to reflect that she must have come in somehow she could not have come through the wall he dashed to the door and fastened the latch but no the wrong thing again i must get away get away he unfastened the latch opened the door and began listening on the staircase he listened a long time somewhere far away it might be in the gateway two voices were loudly and shrilly shouting quarrelling and scolding what are they about he waited patiently at last all was still as though suddenly cut off they had separated he was meaning to go out but suddenly on the floor below a door was noisily opened and someone began going downstairs humming a tune how is it they all make such a noise flashed through his mind once more he closed the door and waited at last all was still not a soul stirring he was just taking a step towards the stairs when he heard fresh footsteps the steps sounded very far off at the very bottom of the stairs but he remembered quite clearly and distinctly that from the first sound he began for some reason to suspect that this was someone coming there to the fourth floor to the old woman why were the sounds somehow peculiar significant the steps were heavy even and unhurried now he had passed the first floor now he was mounting higher it was growing more and more distinct he could hear his heavy breathing and now the third storey had been reached coming here and it seemed to him all at once that he was turned to stone that it was like a dream in which one is being pursued nearly caught and will be killed and is rooted to the spot and cannot even move one s arms at last when the unknown was mounting to the fourth floor he suddenly started and succeeded in slipping neatly and quickly back into the flat and closing the door behind him then he took the hook and softly noiselessly fixed it in the catch instinct helped him when he had done this he crouched holding his breath by the door the unknown visitor was by now also at the door they were now standing opposite one another as he had just before been standing with the old woman when the door divided them and he was listening the visitor panted several times he must be a big fat man thought raskolnikov squeezing the axe in his hand it seemed like a dream indeed the visitor took hold of the bell and rang it loudly as soon as the tin bell tinkled raskolnikov seemed to be aware of something moving in the room for some seconds he listened quite seriously the unknown rang again waited and suddenly tugged violently and impatiently at the handle of the door raskolnikov gazed in horror at the hook shaking in its fastening and in blank terror expected every minute that the fastening would be pulled out it certainly did seem possible so violently was he shaking it he was tempted to hold the fastening but he might be aware of it a giddiness came over him again i shall fall down flashed through his mind but the unknown began to speak and he recovered himself at once what s up are they asleep or murdered d damn them he bawled in a thick voice hey alyona ivanovna old witch lizaveta ivanovna hey my beauty open the door oh damn them are they asleep or what and again enraged he tugged with all his might a dozen times at the bell he must certainly be a man of authority and an intimate acquaintance at this moment light hurried steps were heard not far off on the stairs someone else was approaching raskolnikov had not heard them at first you don t say there s no one at home the new comer cried in a cheerful ringing voice addressing the first visitor who still went on pulling the bell good evening koch from his voice he must be quite young thought raskolnikov who the devil can tell i ve almost broken the lock answered koch but how do you come to know me why the day before yesterday i beat you three times running at billiards at gambrinus oh so they are not at home that s queer it s awfully stupid though where could the old woman have gone i ve come on business yes and i have business with her too well what can we do go back i suppose aie aie and i was hoping to get some money cried the young man we must give it up of course but what did she fix this time for the old witch fixed the time for me to come herself it s out of my way and where the devil she can have got to i can t make out she sits here from year s end to year s end the old hag her legs are bad and yet here all of a sudden she is out for a walk hadn t we better ask the porter what where she s gone and when she ll be back hm damn it all we might ask but you know she never does go anywhere and he once more tugged at the door handle damn it all there s nothing to be done we must go stay cried the young man suddenly do you see how the door shakes if you pull it well that shows it s not locked but fastened with the hook do you hear how the hook clanks well why don t you see that proves that one of them is at home if they were all out they would have locked the door from the outside with the key and not with the hook from inside there do you hear how the hook is clanking to fasten the hook on the inside they must be at home don t you see so there they are sitting inside and don t open the door well and so they must be cried koch astonished what are they about in there and he began furiously shaking the door stay cried the young man again don t pull at it there must be something wrong here you ve been ringing and pulling at the door and still they don t open so either they ve both fainted or what i tell you what let s go fetch the porter let him wake them up all right both were going down stay you stop here while i run down for the porter what for well you d better all right i m studying the law you see it s evident e vi dent there s something wrong here the young man cried hotly and he ran downstairs koch remained once more he softly touched the bell which gave one tinkle then gently as though reflecting and looking about him began touching the door handle pulling it and letting it go to make sure once more that it was only fastened by the hook then puffing and panting he bent down and began looking at the keyhole but the key was in the lock on the inside and so nothing could be seen raskolnikov stood keeping tight hold of the axe he was in a sort of delirium he was even making ready to fight when they should come in while they were knocking and talking together the idea several times occurred to him to end it all at once and shout to them through the door now and then he was tempted to swear at them to jeer at them while they could not open the door only make haste was the thought that flashed through his mind but what the devil is he about time was passing one minute and another no one came koch began to be restless what the devil he cried suddenly and in impatience deserting his sentry duty he too went down hurrying and thumping with his heavy boots on the stairs the steps died away good heavens what am i to do raskolnikov unfastened the hook opened the door there was no sound abruptly without any thought at all he went out closing the door as thoroughly as he could and went downstairs he had gone down three flights when he suddenly heard a loud voice below where could he go there was nowhere to hide he was just going back to the flat hey there catch the brute somebody dashed out of a flat below shouting and rather fell than ran down the stairs bawling at the top of his voice mitka mitka mitka mitka mitka blast him the shout ended in a shriek the last sounds came from the yard all was still but at the same instant several men talking loud and fast began noisily mounting the stairs there were three or four of them he distinguished the ringing voice of the young man they filled with despair he went straight to meet them feeling come what must if they stopped him all was lost if they let him pass all was lost too they would remember him they were approaching they were only a flight from him and suddenly deliverance a few steps from him on the right there was an empty flat with the door wide open the flat on the second floor where the painters had been at work and which as though for his benefit they had just left it was they no doubt who had just run down shouting the floor had only just been painted in the middle of the room stood a pail and a broken pot with paint and brushes in one instant he had whisked in at the open door and hidden behind the wall and only in the nick of time they had already reached the landing then they turned and went on up to the fourth floor talking loudly he waited went out on tiptoe and ran down the stairs no one was on the stairs nor in the gateway he passed quickly through the gateway and turned to the left in the street he knew he knew perfectly well that at that moment they were at the flat that they were greatly astonished at finding it unlocked as the door had just been fastened that by now they were looking at the bodies that before another minute had passed they would guess and completely realise that the murderer had just been there and had succeeded in hiding somewhere slipping by them and escaping they would guess most likely that he had been in the empty flat while they were going upstairs and meanwhile he dared not quicken his pace much though the next turning was still nearly a hundred yards away should he slip through some gateway and wait somewhere in an unknown street no hopeless should he fling away the axe should he take a cab hopeless hopeless at last he reached the turning he turned down it more dead than alive here he was half way to safety and he understood it it was less risky because there was a great crowd of people and he was lost in it like a grain of sand but all he had suffered had so weakened him that he could scarcely move perspiration ran down him in drops his neck was all wet my word he has been going it someone shouted at him when he came out on the canal bank he was only dimly conscious of himself now and the farther he went the worse it was he remembered however that on coming out on to the canal bank he was alarmed at finding few people there and so being more conspicuous and he had thought of turning back though he was almost falling from fatigue he went a long way round so as to get home from quite a different direction he was not fully conscious when he passed through the gateway of his house he was already on the staircase before he recollected the axe and yet he had a very grave problem before him to put it back and to escape observation as far as possible in doing so he was of course incapable of reflecting that it might perhaps be far better not to restore the axe at all but to drop it later on in somebody s yard but it all happened fortunately the door of the porter s room was closed but not locked so that it seemed most likely that the porter was at home but he had so completely lost all power of reflection that he walked straight to the door and opened it if the porter had asked him what do you want he would perhaps have simply handed him the axe but again the porter was not at home and he succeeded in putting the axe back under the bench and even covering it with the chunk of wood as before he met no one not a soul afterwards on the way to his room the landlady s door was shut when he was in his room he flung himself on the sofa just as he was he did not sleep but sank into blank forgetfulness if anyone had come into his room then he would have jumped up at once and screamed scraps and shreds of thoughts were simply swarming in his brain but he could not catch at one he could not rest on one in spite of all his efforts part ii chapter i so he lay a very long while now and then he seemed to wake up and at such moments he noticed that it was far into the night but it did not occur to him to get up at last he noticed that it was beginning to get light he was lying on his back still dazed from his recent oblivion fearful despairing cries rose shrilly from the street sounds which he heard every night indeed under his window after two o clock they woke him up now ah the drunken men are coming out of the taverns he thought it s past two o clock and at once he leaped up as though someone had pulled him from the sofa what past two o clock he sat down on the sofa and instantly recollected everything all at once in one flash he recollected everything for the first moment he thought he was going mad a dreadful chill came over him but the chill was from the fever that had begun long before in his sleep now he was suddenly taken with violent shivering so that his teeth chattered and all his limbs were shaking he opened the door and began listening everything in the house was asleep with amazement he gazed at himself and everything in the room around him wondering how he could have come in the night before without fastening the door and have flung himself on the sofa without undressing without even taking his hat off it had fallen off and was lying on the floor near his pillow if anyone had come in what would he have thought that i m drunk but he rushed to the window there was light enough and he began hurriedly looking himself all over from head to foot all his clothes were there no traces but there was no doing it like that shivering with cold he began taking off everything and looking over again he turned everything over to the last threads and rags and mistrusting himself went through his search three times but there seemed to be nothing no trace except in one place where some thick drops of congealed blood were clinging to the frayed edge of his trousers he picked up a big claspknife and cut off the frayed threads there seemed to be nothing more suddenly he remembered that the purse and the things he had taken out of the old woman s box were still in his pockets he had not thought till then of taking them out and hiding them he had not even thought of them while he was examining his clothes what next instantly he rushed to take them out and fling them on the table when he had pulled out everything and turned the pocket inside out to be sure there was nothing left he carried the whole heap to the corner the paper had come off the bottom of the wall and hung there in tatters he began stuffing all the things into the hole under the paper they re in all out of sight and the purse too he thought gleefully getting up and gazing blankly at the hole which bulged out more than ever suddenly he shuddered all over with horror my god he whispered in despair what s the matter with me is that hidden is that the way to hide things he had not reckoned on having trinkets to hide he had only thought of money and so had not prepared a hiding place but now now what am i glad of he thought is that hiding things my reason s deserting me simply he sat down on the sofa in exhaustion and was at once shaken by another unbearable fit of shivering mechanically he drew from a chair beside him his old student s winter coat which was still warm though almost in rags covered himself up with it and once more sank into drowsiness and delirium he lost consciousness not more than five minutes had passed when he jumped up a second time and at once pounced in a frenzy on his clothes again how could i go to sleep again with nothing done yes yes i have not taken the loop off the armhole i forgot it forgot a thing like that such a piece of evidence he pulled off the noose hurriedly cut it to pieces and threw the bits among his linen under the pillow pieces of torn linen couldn t rouse suspicion whatever happened i think not i think not any way he repeated standing in the middle of the room and with painful concentration he fell to gazing about him again at the floor and everywhere trying to make sure he had not forgotten anything the conviction that all his faculties even memory and the simplest power of reflection were failing him began to be an insufferable torture surely it isn t beginning already surely it isn t my punishment coming upon me it is the frayed rags he had cut off his trousers were actually lying on the floor in the middle of the room where anyone coming in would see them what is the matter with me he cried again like one distraught then a strange idea entered his head that perhaps all his clothes were covered with blood that perhaps there were a great many stains but that he did not see them did not notice them because his perceptions were failing were going to pieces his reason was clouded suddenly he remembered that there had been blood on the purse too ah then there must be blood on the pocket too for i put the wet purse in my pocket in a flash he had turned the pocket inside out and yes there were traces stains on the lining of the pocket so my reason has not quite deserted me so i still have some sense and memory since i guessed it of myself he thought triumphantly with a deep sigh of relief it s simply the weakness of fever a moment s delirium and he tore the whole lining out of the left pocket of his trousers at that instant the sunlight fell on his left boot on the sock which poked out from the boot he fancied there were traces he flung off his boots traces indeed the tip of the sock was soaked with blood he must have unwarily stepped into that pool but what am i to do with this now where am i to put the sock and rags and pocket he gathered them all up in his hands and stood in the middle of the room in the stove but they would ransack the stove first of all burn them but what can i burn them with there are no matches even no better go out and throw it all away somewhere yes better throw it away he repeated sitting down on the sofa again and at once this minute without lingering but his head sank on the pillow instead again the unbearable icy shivering came over him again he drew his coat over him and for a long while for some hours he was haunted by the impulse to go off somewhere at once this moment and fling it all away so that it may be out of sight and done with at once at once several times he tried to rise from the sofa but could not he was thoroughly waked up at last by a violent knocking at his door open do are you dead or alive he keeps sleeping here shouted nastasya banging with her fist on the door for whole days together he s snoring here like a dog a dog he is too open i tell you it s past ten maybe he s not at home said a man s voice ha that s the porter s voice what does he want he jumped up and sat on the sofa the beating of his heart was a positive pain then who can have latched the door retorted nastasya he s taken to bolting himself in as if he were worth stealing open you stupid wake up what do they want why the porter all s discovered resist or open come what may he half rose stooped forward and unlatched the door his room was so small that he could undo the latch without leaving the bed yes the porter and nastasya were standing there nastasya stared at him in a strange way he glanced with a defiant and desperate air at the porter who without a word held out a grey folded paper sealed with bottle wax a notice from the office he announced as he gave him the paper from what office a summons to the police office of course you know which office to the police what for how can i tell you re sent for so you go the man looked at him attentively looked round the room and turned to go away he s downright ill observed nastasya not taking her eyes off him the porter turned his head for a moment he s been in a fever since yesterday she added raskolnikov made no response and held the paper in his hands without opening it don t you get up then nastasya went on compassionately seeing that he was letting his feet down from the sofa you re ill and so don t go there s no such hurry what have you got there he looked in his right hand he held the shreds he had cut from his trousers the sock and the rags of the pocket so he had been asleep with them in his hand afterwards reflecting upon it he remembered that half waking up in his fever he had grasped all this tightly in his hand and so fallen asleep again look at the rags he s collected and sleeps with them as though he has got hold of a treasure and nastasya went off into her hysterical giggle instantly he thrust them all under his great coat and fixed his eyes intently upon her far as he was from being capable of rational reflection at that moment he felt that no one would behave like that with a person who was going to be arrested but the police you d better have some tea yes i ll bring it there s some left no i m going i ll go at once he muttered getting on to his feet why you ll never get downstairs yes i ll go as you please she followed the porter out at once he rushed to the light to examine the sock and the rags there are stains but not very noticeable all covered with dirt and rubbed and already discoloured no one who had no suspicion could distinguish anything nastasya from a distance could not have noticed thank god then with a tremor he broke the seal of the notice and began reading he was a long while reading before he understood it was an ordinary summons from the district police station to appear that day at half past nine at the office of the district superintendent but when has such a thing happened i never have anything to do with the police and why just to day he thought in agonising bewilderment good god only get it over soon he was flinging himself on his knees to pray but broke into laughter not at the idea of prayer but at himself he began hurriedly dressing if i m lost i am lost i don t care shall i put the sock on he suddenly wondered it will get dustier still and the traces will be gone but no sooner had he put it on than he pulled it off again in loathing and horror he pulled it off but reflecting that he had no other socks he picked it up and put it on again and again he laughed that s all conventional that s all relative merely a way of looking at it he thought in a flash but only on the top surface of his mind while he was shuddering all over there i ve got it on i have finished by getting it on but his laughter was quickly followed by despair no it s too much for me he thought his legs shook from fear he muttered his head swam and ached with fever it s a trick they want to decoy me there and confound me over everything he mused as he went out on to the stairs the worst of it is i m almost light headed i may blurt out something stupid on the stairs he remembered that he was leaving all the things just as they were in the hole in the wall and very likely it s on purpose to search when i m out he thought and stopped short but he was possessed by such despair such cynicism of misery if one may so call it that with a wave of his hand he went on only to get it over in the street the heat was insufferable again not a drop of rain had fallen all those days again dust bricks and mortar again the stench from the shops and pot houses again the drunken men the finnish pedlars and half broken down cabs the sun shone straight in his eyes so that it hurt him to look out of them and he felt his head going round as a man in a fever is apt to feel when he comes out into the street on a bright sunny day when he reached the turning into the street in an agony of trepidation he looked down it at the house and at once averted his eyes if they question me perhaps i ll simply tell he thought as he drew near the police station the police station was about a quarter of a mile off it had lately been moved to new rooms on the fourth floor of a new house he had been once for a moment in the old office but long ago turning in at the gateway he saw on the right a flight of stairs which a peasant was mounting with a book in his hand a house porter no doubt so then the office is here and he began ascending the stairs on the chance he did not want to ask questions of anyone i ll go in fall on my knees and confess everything he thought as he reached the fourth floor the staircase was steep narrow and all sloppy with dirty water the kitchens of the flats opened on to the stairs and stood open almost the whole day so there was a fearful smell and heat the staircase was crowded with porters going up and down with their books under their arms policemen and persons of all sorts and both sexes the door of the office too stood wide open peasants stood waiting within there too the heat was stifling and there was a sickening smell of fresh paint and stale oil from the newly decorated rooms after waiting a little he decided to move forward into the next room all the rooms were small and low pitched a fearful impatience drew him on and on no one paid attention to him in the second room some clerks sat writing dressed hardly better than he was and rather a queer looking set he went up to one of them what is it he showed the notice he had received you are a student the man asked glancing at the notice yes formerly a student the clerk looked at him but without the slightest interest he was a particularly unkempt person with the look of a fixed idea in his eye there would be no getting anything out of him because he has no interest in anything thought raskolnikov go in there to the head clerk said the clerk pointing towards the furthest room he went into that room the fourth in order it was a small room and packed full of people rather better dressed than in the outer rooms among them were two ladies one poorly dressed in mourning sat at the table opposite the chief clerk writing something at his dictation the other a very stout buxom woman with a purplish red blotchy face excessively smartly dressed with a brooch on her bosom as big as a saucer was standing on one side apparently waiting for something raskolnikov thrust his notice upon the head clerk the latter glanced at it said wait a minute and went on attending to the lady in mourning he breathed more freely it can t be that by degrees he began to regain confidence he kept urging himself to have courage and be calm some foolishness some trifling carelessness and i may betray myself hm it s a pity there s no air here he added it s stifling it makes one s head dizzier than ever and one s mind too he was conscious of a terrible inner turmoil he was afraid of losing his self control he tried to catch at something and fix his mind on it something quite irrelevant but he could not succeed in this at all yet the head clerk greatly interested him he kept hoping to see through him and guess something from his face he was a very young man about two and twenty with a dark mobile face that looked older than his years he was fashionably dressed and foppish with his hair parted in the middle well combed and pomaded and wore a number of rings on his well scrubbed fingers and a gold chain on his waistcoat he said a couple of words in french to a foreigner who was in the room and said them fairly correctly luise ivanovna you can sit down he said casually to the gaily dressed purple faced lady who was still standing as though not venturing to sit down though there was a chair beside her ich danke said the latter and softly with a rustle of silk she sank into the chair her light blue dress trimmed with white lace floated about the table like an air balloon and filled almost half the room she smelt of scent but she was obviously embarrassed at filling half the room and smelling so strongly of scent and though her smile was impudent as well as cringing it betrayed evident uneasiness the lady in mourning had done at last and got up all at once with some noise an officer walked in very jauntily with a peculiar swing of his shoulders at each step he tossed his cockaded cap on the table and sat down in an easy chair the small lady positively skipped from her seat on seeing him and fell to curtsying in a sort of ecstasy but the officer took not the smallest notice of her and she did not venture to sit down again in his presence he was the assistant superintendent he had a reddish moustache that stood out horizontally on each side of his face and extremely small features expressive of nothing much except a certain insolence he looked askance and rather indignantly at raskolnikov he was so very badly dressed and in spite of his humiliating position his bearing was by no means in keeping with his clothes raskolnikov had unwarily fixed a very long and direct look on him so that he felt positively affronted what do you want he shouted apparently astonished that such a ragged fellow was not annihilated by the majesty of his glance i was summoned by a notice raskolnikov faltered for the recovery of money due from the student the head clerk interfered hurriedly tearing himself from his papers here and he flung raskolnikov a document and pointed out the place read that money what money thought raskolnikov but then it s certainly not that and he trembled with joy he felt sudden intense indescribable relief a load was lifted from his back and pray what time were you directed to appear sir shouted the assistant superintendent seeming for some unknown reason more and more aggrieved you are told to come at nine and now it s twelve the notice was only brought me a quarter of an hour ago raskolnikov answered loudly over his shoulder to his own surprise he too grew suddenly angry and found a certain pleasure in it and it s enough that i have come here ill with fever kindly refrain from shouting i m not shouting i m speaking very quietly it s you who are shouting at me i m a student and allow no one to shout at me the assistant superintendent was so furious that for the first minute he could only splutter inarticulately he leaped up from his seat be silent you are in a government office don t be impudent sir you re in a government office too cried raskolnikov and you re smoking a cigarette as well as shouting so you are showing disrespect to all of us he felt an indescribable satisfaction at having said this the head clerk looked at him with a smile the angry assistant superintendent was obviously disconcerted that s not your business he shouted at last with unnatural loudness kindly make the declaration demanded of you show him alexandr grigorievitch there is a complaint against you you don t pay your debts you re a fine bird but raskolnikov was not listening now he had eagerly clutched at the paper in haste to find an explanation he read it once and a second time and still did not understand what is this he asked the head clerk it is for the recovery of money on an i o u a writ you must either pay it with all expenses costs and so on or give a written declaration when you can pay it and at the same time an undertaking not to leave the capital without payment and nor to sell or conceal your property the creditor is at liberty to sell your property and proceed against you according to the law but i am not in debt to anyone that s not our business here an i o u for a hundred and fifteen roubles legally attested and due for payment has been brought us for recovery given by you to the widow of the assessor zarnitsyn nine months ago and paid over by the widow zarnitsyn to one mr tchebarov we therefore summon you hereupon but she is my landlady and what if she is your landlady the head clerk looked at him with a condescending smile of compassion and at the same time with a certain triumph as at a novice under fire for the first time as though he would say well how do you feel now but what did he care now for an i o u for a writ of recovery was that worth worrying about now was it worth attention even he stood he read he listened he answered he even asked questions himself but all mechanically the triumphant sense of security of deliverance from overwhelming danger that was what filled his whole soul that moment without thought for the future without analysis without suppositions or surmises without doubts and without questioning it was an instant of full direct purely instinctive joy but at that very moment something like a thunderstorm took place in the office the assistant superintendent still shaken by raskolnikov s disrespect still fuming and obviously anxious to keep up his wounded dignity pounced on the unfortunate smart lady who had been gazing at him ever since he came in with an exceedingly silly smile you shameful hussy he shouted suddenly at the top of his voice the lady in mourning had left the office what was going on at your house last night eh a disgrace again you re a scandal to the whole street fighting and drinking again do you want the house of correction why i have warned you ten times over that i would not let you off the eleventh and here you are again again you you the paper fell out of raskolnikov s hands and he looked wildly at the smart lady who was so unceremoniously treated but he soon saw what it meant and at once began to find positive amusement in the scandal he listened with pleasure so that he longed to laugh and laugh all his nerves were on edge ilya petrovitch the head clerk was beginning anxiously but stopped short for he knew from experience that the enraged assistant could not be stopped except by force as for the smart lady at first she positively trembled before the storm but strange to say the more numerous and violent the terms of abuse became the more amiable she looked and the more seductive the smiles she lavished on the terrible assistant she moved uneasily and curtsied incessantly waiting impatiently for a chance of putting in her word and at last she found it there was no sort of noise or fighting in my house mr captain she pattered all at once like peas dropping speaking russian confidently though with a strong german accent and no sort of scandal and his honour came drunk and it s the whole truth i am telling mr captain and i am not to blame mine is an honourable house mr captain and honourable behaviour mr captain and i always always dislike any scandal myself but he came quite tipsy and asked for three bottles again and then he lifted up one leg and began playing the pianoforte with one foot and that is not at all right in an honourable house and he ganz broke the piano and it was very bad manners indeed and i said so and he took up a bottle and began hitting everyone with it and then i called the porter and karl came and he took karl and hit him in the eye and he hit henriette in the eye too and gave me five slaps on the cheek and it was so ungentlemanly in an honourable house mr captain and i screamed and he opened the window over the canal and stood in the window squealing like a little pig it was a disgrace the idea of squealing like a little pig at the window into the street fie upon him and karl pulled him away from the window by his coat and it is true mr captain he tore sein rock and then he shouted that man muss pay him fifteen roubles damages and i did pay him mr captain five roubles for sein rock and he is an ungentlemanly visitor and caused all the scandal i will show you up he said for i can write to all the papers about you then he was an author yes mr captain and what an ungentlemanly visitor in an honourable house now then enough i have told you already ilya petrovitch the head clerk repeated significantly the assistant glanced rapidly at him the head clerk slightly shook his head so i tell you this most respectable luise ivanovna and i tell it you for the last time the assistant went on if there is a scandal in your honourable house once again i will put you yourself in the lock up as it is called in polite society do you hear so a literary man an author took five roubles for his coat tail in an honourable house a nice set these authors and he cast a contemptuous glance at raskolnikov there was a scandal the other day in a restaurant too an author had eaten his dinner and would not pay i ll write a satire on you says he and there was another of them on a steamer last week used the most disgraceful language to the respectable family of a civil councillor his wife and daughter and there was one of them turned out of a confectioner s shop the other day they are like that authors literary men students town criers pfoo you get along i shall look in upon you myself one day then you had better be careful do you hear with hurried deference luise ivanovna fell to curtsying in all directions and so curtsied herself to the door but at the door she stumbled backwards against a good looking officer with a fresh open face and splendid thick fair whiskers this was the superintendent of the district himself nikodim fomitch luise ivanovna made haste to curtsy almost to the ground and with mincing little steps she fluttered out of the office again thunder and lightning a hurricane said nikodim fomitch to ilya petrovitch in a civil and friendly tone you are aroused again you are fuming again i heard it on the stairs well what then ilya petrovitch drawled with gentlemanly nonchalance and he walked with some papers to another table with a jaunty swing of his shoulders at each step here if you will kindly look an author or a student has been one at least does not pay his debts has given an i o u won t clear out of his room and complaints are constantly being lodged against him and here he has been pleased to make a protest against my smoking in his presence he behaves like a cad himself and just look at him please here s the gentleman and very attractive he is poverty is not a vice my friend but we know you go off like powder you can t bear a slight i daresay you took offence at something and went too far yourself continued nikodim fomitch turning affably to raskolnikov but you were wrong there he is a capital fellow i assure you but explosive explosive he gets hot fires up boils over and no stopping him and then it s all over and at the bottom he s a heart of gold his nickname in the regiment was the explosive lieutenant and what a regiment it was too cried ilya petrovitch much gratified at this agreeable banter though still sulky raskolnikov had a sudden desire to say something exceptionally pleasant to them all excuse me captain he began easily suddenly addressing nikodim fomitch will you enter into my position i am ready to ask pardon if i have been ill mannered i am a poor student sick and shattered shattered was the word he used by poverty i am not studying because i cannot keep myself now but i shall get money i have a mother and sister in the province of x they will send it to me and i will pay my landlady is a good hearted woman but she is so exasperated at my having lost my lessons and not paying her for the last four months that she does not even send up my dinner and i don t understand this i o u at all she is asking me to pay her on this i o u how am i to pay her judge for yourselves but that is not our business you know the head clerk was observing yes yes i perfectly agree with you but allow me to explain raskolnikov put in again still addressing nikodim fomitch but trying his best to address ilya petrovitch also though the latter persistently appeared to be rummaging among his papers and to be contemptuously oblivious of him allow me to explain that i have been living with her for nearly three years and at first at first for why should i not confess it at the very beginning i promised to marry her daughter it was a verbal promise freely given she was a girl indeed i liked her though i was not in love with her a youthful affair in fact that is i mean to say that my landlady gave me credit freely in those days and i led a life of i was very heedless nobody asks you for these personal details sir we ve no time to waste ilya petrovitch interposed roughly and with a note of triumph but raskolnikov stopped him hotly though he suddenly found it exceedingly difficult to speak but excuse me excuse me it is for me to explain how it all happened in my turn though i agree with you it is unnecessary but a year ago the girl died of typhus i remained lodging there as before and when my landlady moved into her present quarters she said to me and in a friendly way that she had complete trust in me but still would i not give her an i o u for one hundred and fifteen roubles all the debt i owed her she said if only i gave her that she would trust me again as much as i liked and that she would never never those were her own words make use of that i o u till i could pay of myself and now when i have lost my lessons and have nothing to eat she takes action against me what am i to say to that all these affecting details are no business of ours ilya petrovitch interrupted rudely you must give a written undertaking but as for your love affairs and all these tragic events we have nothing to do with that come now you are harsh muttered nikodim fomitch sitting down at the table and also beginning to write he looked a little ashamed write said the head clerk to raskolnikov write what the latter asked gruffly i will dictate to you raskolnikov fancied that the head clerk treated him more casually and contemptuously after his speech but strange to say he suddenly felt completely indifferent to anyone s opinion and this revulsion took place in a flash in one instant if he had cared to think a little he would have been amazed indeed that he could have talked to them like that a minute before forcing his feelings upon them and where had those feelings come from now if the whole room had been filled not with police officers but with those nearest and dearest to him he would not have found one human word for them so empty was his heart a gloomy sensation of agonising everlasting solitude and remoteness took conscious form in his soul it was not the meanness of his sentimental effusions before ilya petrovitch nor the meanness of the latter s triumph over him that had caused this sudden revulsion in his heart oh what had he to do now with his own baseness with all these petty vanities officers german women debts police offices if he had been sentenced to be burnt at that moment he would not have stirred would hardly have heard the sentence to the end something was happening to him entirely new sudden and unknown it was not that he understood but he felt clearly with all the intensity of sensation that he could never more appeal to these people in the police office with sentimental effusions like his recent outburst or with anything whatever and that if they had been his own brothers and sisters and not police officers it would have been utterly out of the question to appeal to them in any circumstance of life he had never experienced such a strange and awful sensation and what was most agonising it was more a sensation than a conception or idea a direct sensation the most agonising of all the sensations he had known in his life the head clerk began dictating to him the usual form of declaration that he could not pay that he undertook to do so at a future date that he would not leave the town nor sell his property and so on but you can t write you can hardly hold the pen observed the head clerk looking with curiosity at raskolnikov are you ill yes i am giddy go on that s all sign it the head clerk took the paper and turned to attend to others raskolnikov gave back the pen but instead of getting up and going away he put his elbows on the table and pressed his head in his hands he felt as if a nail were being driven into his skull a strange idea suddenly occurred to him to get up at once to go up to nikodim fomitch and tell him everything that had happened yesterday and then to go with him to his lodgings and to show him the things in the hole in the corner the impulse was so strong that he got up from his seat to carry it out hadn t i better think a minute flashed through his mind no better cast off the burden without thinking but all at once he stood still rooted to the spot nikodim fomitch was talking eagerly with ilya petrovitch and the words reached him it s impossible they ll both be released to begin with the whole story contradicts itself why should they have called the porter if it had been their doing to inform against themselves or as a blind no that would be too cunning besides pestryakov the student was seen at the gate by both the porters and a woman as he went in he was walking with three friends who left him only at the gate and he asked the porters to direct him in the presence of the friends now would he have asked his way if he had been going with such an object as for koch he spent half an hour at the silversmith s below before he went up to the old woman and he left him at exactly a quarter to eight now just consider but excuse me how do you explain this contradiction they state themselves that they knocked and the door was locked yet three minutes later when they went up with the porter it turned out the door was unfastened that s just it the murderer must have been there and bolted himself in and they d have caught him for a certainty if koch had not been an ass and gone to look for the porter too he must have seized the interval to get downstairs and slip by them somehow koch keeps crossing himself and saying if i had been there he would have jumped out and killed me with his axe he is going to have a thanksgiving service ha ha and no one saw the murderer they might well not see him the house is a regular noah s ark said the head clerk who was listening it s clear quite clear nikodim fomitch repeated warmly no it is anything but clear ilya petrovitch maintained raskolnikov picked up his hat and walked towards the door but he did not reach it when he recovered consciousness he found himself sitting in a chair supported by someone on the right side while someone else was standing on the left holding a yellowish glass filled with yellow water and nikodim fomitch standing before him looking intently at him he got up from the chair what s this are you ill nikodim fomitch asked rather sharply he could hardly hold his pen when he was signing said the head clerk settling back in his place and taking up his work again have you been ill long cried ilya petrovitch from his place where he too was looking through papers he had of course come to look at the sick man when he fainted but retired at once when he recovered since yesterday muttered raskolnikov in reply did you go out yesterday yes though you were ill yes at what time about seven and where did you go my i ask along the street short and clear raskolnikov white as a handkerchief had answered sharply jerkily without dropping his black feverish eyes before ilya petrovitch s stare he can scarcely stand upright and you nikodim fomitch was beginning no matter ilya petrovitch pronounced rather peculiarly nikodim fomitch would have made some further protest but glancing at the head clerk who was looking very hard at him he did not speak there was a sudden silence it was strange very well then concluded ilya petrovitch we will not detain you raskolnikov went out he caught the sound of eager conversation on his departure and above the rest rose the questioning voice of nikodim fomitch in the street his faintness passed off completely a search there will be a search at once he repeated to himself hurrying home the brutes they suspect his former terror mastered him completely again chapter ii and what if there has been a search already what if i find them in my room but here was his room nothing and no one in it no one had peeped in even nastasya had not touched it but heavens how could he have left all those things in the hole he rushed to the corner slipped his hand under the paper pulled the things out and lined his pockets with them there were eight articles in all two little boxes with ear rings or something of the sort he hardly looked to see then four small leather cases there was a chain too merely wrapped in newspaper and something else in newspaper that looked like a decoration he put them all in the different pockets of his overcoat and the remaining pocket of his trousers trying to conceal them as much as possible he took the purse too then he went out of his room leaving the door open he walked quickly and resolutely and though he felt shattered he had his senses about him he was afraid of pursuit he was afraid that in another half hour another quarter of an hour perhaps instructions would be issued for his pursuit and so at all costs he must hide all traces before then he must clear everything up while he still had some strength some reasoning power left him where was he to go that had long been settled fling them into the canal and all traces hidden in the water the thing would be at an end so he had decided in the night of his delirium when several times he had had the impulse to get up and go away to make haste and get rid of it all but to get rid of it turned out to be a very difficult task he wandered along the bank of the ekaterininsky canal for half an hour or more and looked several times at the steps running down to the water but he could not think of carrying out his plan either rafts stood at the steps edge and women were washing clothes on them or boats were moored there and people were swarming everywhere moreover he could be seen and noticed from the banks on all sides it would look suspicious for a man to go down on purpose stop and throw something into the water and what if the boxes were to float instead of sinking and of course they would even as it was everyone he met seemed to stare and look round as if they had nothing to do but to watch him why is it or can it be my fancy he thought at last the thought struck him that it might be better to go to the neva there were not so many people there he would be less observed and it would be more convenient in every way above all it was further off he wondered how he could have been wandering for a good half hour worried and anxious in this dangerous past without thinking of it before and that half hour he had lost over an irrational plan simply because he had thought of it in delirium he had become extremely absent and forgetful and he was aware of it he certainly must make haste he walked towards the neva along v prospect but on the way another idea struck him why to the neva would it not be better to go somewhere far off to the islands again and there hide the things in some solitary place in a wood or under a bush and mark the spot perhaps and though he felt incapable of clear judgment the idea seemed to him a sound one but he was not destined to go there for coming out of v prospect towards the square he saw on the left a passage leading between two blank walls to a courtyard on the right hand the blank unwhitewashed wall of a four storied house stretched far into the court on the left a wooden hoarding ran parallel with it for twenty paces into the court and then turned sharply to the left here was a deserted fenced off place where rubbish of different sorts was lying at the end of the court the corner of a low smutty stone shed apparently part of some workshop peeped from behind the hoarding it was probably a carriage builder s or carpenter s shed the whole place from the entrance was black with coal dust here would be the place to throw it he thought not seeing anyone in the yard he slipped in and at once saw near the gate a sink such as is often put in yards where there are many workmen or cab drivers and on the hoarding above had been scribbled in chalk the time honoured witticism standing here strictly forbidden this was all the better for there would be nothing suspicious about his going in here i could throw it all in a heap and get away looking round once more with his hand already in his pocket he noticed against the outer wall between the entrance and the sink a big unhewn stone weighing perhaps sixty pounds the other side of the wall was a street he could hear passers by always numerous in that part but he could not be seen from the entrance unless someone came in from the street which might well happen indeed so there was need of haste he bent down over the stone seized the top of it firmly in both hands and using all his strength turned it over under the stone was a small hollow in the ground and he immediately emptied his pocket into it the purse lay at the top and yet the hollow was not filled up then he seized the stone again and with one twist turned it back so that it was in the same position again though it stood a very little higher but he scraped the earth about it and pressed it at the edges with his foot nothing could be noticed then he went out and turned into the square again an intense almost unbearable joy overwhelmed him for an instant as it had in the police office i have buried my tracks and who who can think of looking under that stone it has been lying there most likely ever since the house was built and will lie as many years more and if it were found who would think of me it is all over no clue and he laughed yes he remembered that he began laughing a thin nervous noiseless laugh and went on laughing all the time he was crossing the square but when he reached the k boulevard where two days before he had come upon that girl his laughter suddenly ceased other ideas crept into his mind he felt all at once that it would be loathsome to pass that seat on which after the girl was gone he had sat and pondered and that it would be hateful too to meet that whiskered policeman to whom he had given the twenty copecks damn him he walked looking about him angrily and distractedly all his ideas now seemed to be circling round some single point and he felt that there really was such a point and that now now he was left facing that point and for the first time indeed during the last two months damn it all he thought suddenly in a fit of ungovernable fury if it has begun then it has begun hang the new life good lord how stupid it is and what lies i told to day how despicably i fawned upon that wretched ilya petrovitch but that is all folly what do i care for them all and my fawning upon them it is not that at all it is not that at all suddenly he stopped a new utterly unexpected and exceedingly simple question perplexed and bitterly confounded him if it all has really been done deliberately and not idiotically if i really had a certain and definite object how is it i did not even glance into the purse and don t know what i had there for which i have undergone these agonies and have deliberately undertaken this base filthy degrading business and here i wanted at once to throw into the water the purse together with all the things which i had not seen either how s that yes that was so that was all so yet he had known it all before and it was not a new question for him even when it was decided in the night without hesitation and consideration as though so it must be as though it could not possibly be otherwise yes he had known it all and understood it all it surely had all been settled even yesterday at the moment when he was bending over the box and pulling the jewel cases out of it yes so it was it is because i am very ill he decided grimly at last i have been worrying and fretting myself and i don t know what i am doing yesterday and the day before yesterday and all this time i have been worrying myself i shall get well and i shall not worry but what if i don t get well at all good god how sick i am of it all he walked on without resting he had a terrible longing for some distraction but he did not know what to do what to attempt a new overwhelming sensation was gaining more and more mastery over him every moment this was an immeasurable almost physical repulsion for everything surrounding him an obstinate malignant feeling of hatred all who met him were loathsome to him he loathed their faces their movements their gestures if anyone had addressed him he felt that he might have spat at him or bitten him he stopped suddenly on coming out on the bank of the little neva near the bridge to vassilyevsky ostrov why he lives here in that house he thought why i have not come to razumihin of my own accord here it s the same thing over again very interesting to know though have i come on purpose or have i simply walked here by chance never mind i said the day before yesterday that i would go and see him the day after well and so i will besides i really cannot go further now he went up to razumihin s room on the fifth floor the latter was at home in his garret busily writing at the moment and he opened the door himself it was four months since they had seen each other razumihin was sitting in a ragged dressing gown with slippers on his bare feet unkempt unshaven and unwashed his face showed surprise is it you he cried he looked his comrade up and down then after a brief pause he whistled as hard up as all that why brother you ve cut me out he added looking at raskolnikov s rags come sit down you are tired i ll be bound and when he had sunk down on the american leather sofa which was in even worse condition than his own razumihin saw at once that his visitor was ill why you are seriously ill do you know that he began feeling his pulse raskolnikov pulled away his hand never mind he said i have come for this i have no lessons i wanted but i don t really want lessons but i say you are delirious you know razumihin observed watching him carefully no i am not raskolnikov got up from the sofa as he had mounted the stairs to razumihin s he had not realised that he would be meeting his friend face to face now in a flash he knew that what he was least of all disposed for at that moment was to be face to face with anyone in the wide world his spleen rose within him he almost choked with rage at himself as soon as he crossed razumihin s threshold good bye he said abruptly and walked to the door stop stop you queer fish i don t want to said the other again pulling away his hand then why the devil have you come are you mad or what why this is almost insulting i won t let you go like that well then i came to you because i know no one but you who could help to begin because you are kinder than anyone cleverer i mean and can judge and now i see that i want nothing do you hear nothing at all no one s services no one s sympathy i am by myself alone come that s enough leave me alone stay a minute you sweep you are a perfect madman as you like for all i care i have no lessons do you see and i don t care about that but there s a bookseller heruvimov and he takes the place of a lesson i would not exchange him for five lessons he s doing publishing of a kind and issuing natural science manuals and what a circulation they have the very titles are worth the money you always maintained that i was a fool but by jove my boy there are greater fools than i am now he is setting up for being advanced not that he has an inkling of anything but of course i encourage him here are two signatures of the german text in my opinion the crudest charlatanism it discusses the question is woman a human being and of course triumphantly proves that she is heruvimov is going to bring out this work as a contribution to the woman question i am translating it he will expand these two and a half signatures into six we shall make up a gorgeous title half a page long and bring it out at half a rouble it will do he pays me six roubles the signature it works out to about fifteen roubles for the job and i ve had six already in advance when we have finished this we are going to begin a translation about whales and then some of the dullest scandals out of the second part of les confessions we have marked for translation somebody has told heruvimov that rousseau was a kind of radishchev you may be sure i don t contradict him hang him well would you like to do the second signature of is woman a human being if you would take the german and pens and paper all those are provided and take three roubles for as i have had six roubles in advance on the whole thing three roubles come to you for your share and when you have finished the signature there will be another three roubles for you and please don t think i am doing you a service quite the contrary as soon as you came in i saw how you could help me to begin with i am weak in spelling and secondly i am sometimes utterly adrift in german so that i make it up as i go along for the most part the only comfort is that it s bound to be a change for the better though who can tell maybe it s sometimes for the worse will you take it raskolnikov took the german sheets in silence took the three roubles and without a word went out razumihin gazed after him in astonishment but when raskolnikov was in the next street he turned back mounted the stairs to razumihin s again and laying on the table the german article and the three roubles went out again still without uttering a word are you raving or what razumihin shouted roused to fury at last what farce is this you ll drive me crazy too what did you come to see me for damn you i don t want translation muttered raskolnikov from the stairs then what the devil do you want shouted razumihin from above raskolnikov continued descending the staircase in silence hey there where are you living no answer well confound you then but raskolnikov was already stepping into the street on the nikolaevsky bridge he was roused to full consciousness again by an unpleasant incident a coachman after shouting at him two or three times gave him a violent lash on the back with his whip for having almost fallen under his horses hoofs the lash so infuriated him that he dashed away to the railing for some unknown reason he had been walking in the very middle of the bridge in the traffic he angrily clenched and ground his teeth he heard laughter of course serves him right a pickpocket i dare say pretending to be drunk for sure and getting under the wheels on purpose and you have to answer for him it s a regular profession that s what it is but while he stood at the railing still looking angry and bewildered after the retreating carriage and rubbing his back he suddenly felt someone thrust money into his hand he looked it was an elderly woman in a kerchief and goatskin shoes with a girl probably her daughter wearing a hat and carrying a green parasol take it my good man in christ s name he took it and they passed on it was a piece of twenty copecks from his dress and appearance they might well have taken him for a beggar asking alms in the streets and the gift of the twenty copecks he doubtless owed to the blow which made them feel sorry for him he closed his hand on the twenty copecks walked on for ten paces and turned facing the neva looking towards the palace the sky was without a cloud and the water was almost bright blue which is so rare in the neva the cupola of the cathedral which is seen at its best from the bridge about twenty paces from the chapel glittered in the sunlight and in the pure air every ornament on it could be clearly distinguished the pain from the lash went off and raskolnikov forgot about it one uneasy and not quite definite idea occupied him now completely he stood still and gazed long and intently into the distance this spot was especially familiar to him when he was attending the university he had hundreds of times generally on his way home stood still on this spot gazed at this truly magnificent spectacle and almost always marvelled at a vague and mysterious emotion it roused in him it left him strangely cold this gorgeous picture was for him blank and lifeless he wondered every time at his sombre and enigmatic impression and mistrusting himself put off finding the explanation of it he vividly recalled those old doubts and perplexities and it seemed to him that it was no mere chance that he recalled them now it struck him as strange and grotesque that he should have stopped at the same spot as before as though he actually imagined he could think the same thoughts be interested in the same theories and pictures that had interested him so short a time ago he felt it almost amusing and yet it wrung his heart deep down hidden far away out of sight all that seemed to him now all his old past his old thoughts his old problems and theories his old impressions and that picture and himself and all all he felt as though he were flying upwards and everything were vanishing from his sight making an unconscious movement with his hand he suddenly became aware of the piece of money in his fist he opened his hand stared at the coin and with a sweep of his arm flung it into the water then he turned and went home it seemed to him he had cut himself off from everyone and from everything at that moment evening was coming on when he reached home so that he must have been walking about six hours how and where he came back he did not remember undressing and quivering like an overdriven horse he lay down on the sofa drew his greatcoat over him and at once sank into oblivion it was dusk when he was waked up by a fearful scream good god what a scream such unnatural sounds such howling wailing grinding tears blows and curses he had never heard he could never have imagined such brutality such frenzy in terror he sat up in bed almost swooning with agony but the fighting wailing and cursing grew louder and louder and then to his intense amazement he caught the voice of his landlady she was howling shrieking and wailing rapidly hurriedly incoherently so that he could not make out what she was talking about she was beseeching no doubt not to be beaten for she was being mercilessly beaten on the stairs the voice of her assailant was so horrible from spite and rage that it was almost a croak but he too was saying something and just as quickly and indistinctly hurrying and spluttering all at once raskolnikov trembled he recognised the voice it was the voice of ilya petrovitch ilya petrovitch here and beating the landlady he is kicking her banging her head against the steps that s clear that can be told from the sounds from the cries and the thuds how is it is the world topsy turvy he could hear people running in crowds from all the storeys and all the staircases he heard voices exclamations knocking doors banging but why why and how could it be he repeated thinking seriously that he had gone mad but no he heard too distinctly and they would come to him then next for no doubt it s all about that about yesterday good god he would have fastened his door with the latch but he could not lift his hand besides it would be useless terror gripped his heart like ice tortured him and numbed him but at last all this uproar after continuing about ten minutes began gradually to subside the landlady was moaning and groaning ilya petrovitch was still uttering threats and curses but at last he too seemed to be silent and now he could not be heard can he have gone away good lord yes and now the landlady is going too still weeping and moaning and then her door slammed now the crowd was going from the stairs to their rooms exclaiming disputing calling to one another raising their voices to a shout dropping them to a whisper there must have been numbers of them almost all the inmates of the block but good god how could it be and why why had he come here raskolnikov sank worn out on the sofa but could not close his eyes he lay for half an hour in such anguish such an intolerable sensation of infinite terror as he had never experienced before suddenly a bright light flashed into his room nastasya came in with a candle and a plate of soup looking at him carefully and ascertaining that he was not asleep she set the candle on the table and began to lay out what she had brought bread salt a plate a spoon you ve eaten nothing since yesterday i warrant you ve been trudging about all day and you re shaking with fever nastasya what were they beating the landlady for she looked intently at him who beat the landlady just now half an hour ago ilya petrovitch the assistant superintendent on the stairs why was he ill treating her like that and why was he here nastasya scrutinised him silent and frowning and her scrutiny lasted a long time he felt uneasy even frightened at her searching eyes nastasya why don t you speak he said timidly at last in a weak voice it s the blood she answered at last softly as though speaking to herself blood what blood he muttered growing white and turning towards the wall nastasya still looked at him without speaking nobody has been beating the landlady she declared at last in a firm resolute voice he gazed at her hardly able to breathe i heard it myself i was not asleep i was sitting up he said still more timidly i listened a long while the assistant superintendent came everyone ran out on to the stairs from all the flats no one has been here that s the blood crying in your ears when there s no outlet for it and it gets clotted you begin fancying things will you eat something he made no answer nastasya still stood over him watching him give me something to drink nastasya she went downstairs and returned with a white earthenware jug of water he remembered only swallowing one sip of the cold water and spilling some on his neck then followed forgetfulness chapter iii he was not completely unconscious however all the time he was ill he was in a feverish state sometimes delirious sometimes half conscious he remembered a great deal afterwards sometimes it seemed as though there were a number of people round him they wanted to take him away somewhere there was a great deal of squabbling and discussing about him then he would be alone in the room they had all gone away afraid of him and only now and then opened the door a crack to look at him they threatened him plotted something together laughed and mocked at him he remembered nastasya often at his bedside he distinguished another person too whom he seemed to know very well though he could not remember who he was and this fretted him even made him cry sometimes he fancied he had been lying there a month at other times it all seemed part of the same day but of that of that he had no recollection and yet every minute he felt that he had forgotten something he ought to remember he worried and tormented himself trying to remember moaned flew into a rage or sank into awful intolerable terror then he struggled to get up would have run away but someone always prevented him by force and he sank back into impotence and forgetfulness at last he returned to complete consciousness it happened at ten o clock in the morning on fine days the sun shone into the room at that hour throwing a streak of light on the right wall and the corner near the door nastasya was standing beside him with another person a complete stranger who was looking at him very inquisitively he was a young man with a beard wearing a full short waisted coat and looked like a messenger the landlady was peeping in at the half opened door raskolnikov sat up who is this nastasya he asked pointing to the young man i say he s himself again she said he is himself echoed the man concluding that he had returned to his senses the landlady closed the door and disappeared she was always shy and dreaded conversations or discussions she was a woman of forty not at all bad looking fat and buxom with black eyes and eyebrows good natured from fatness and laziness and absurdly bashful who are you he went on addressing the man but at that moment the door was flung open and stooping a little as he was so tall razumihin came in what a cabin it is he cried i am always knocking my head you call this a lodging so you are conscious brother i ve just heard the news from pashenka he has just come to said nastasya just come to echoed the man again with a smile and who are you razumihin asked suddenly addressing him my name is vrazumihin at your service not razumihin as i am always called but vrazumihin a student and gentleman and he is my friend and who are you i am the messenger from our office from the merchant shelopaev and i ve come on business please sit down razumihin seated himself on the other side of the table it s a good thing you ve come to brother he went on to raskolnikov for the last four days you have scarcely eaten or drunk anything we had to give you tea in spoonfuls i brought zossimov to see you twice you remember zossimov he examined you carefully and said at once it was nothing serious something seemed to have gone to your head some nervous nonsense the result of bad feeding he says you have not had enough beer and radish but it s nothing much it will pass and you will be all right zossimov is a first rate fellow he is making quite a name come i won t keep you he said addressing the man again will you explain what you want you must know rodya this is the second time they have sent from the office but it was another man last time and i talked to him who was it came before that was the day before yesterday i venture to say if you please sir that was alexey semyonovitch he is in our office too he was more intelligent than you don t you think so yes indeed sir he is of more weight than i am quite so go on at your mamma s request through afanasy ivanovitch vahrushin of whom i presume you have heard more than once a remittance is sent to you from our office the man began addressing raskolnikov if you are in an intelligible condition i ve thirty five roubles to remit to you as semyon semyonovitch has received from afanasy ivanovitch at your mamma s request instructions to that effect as on previous occasions do you know him sir yes i remember vahrushin raskolnikov said dreamily you hear he knows vahrushin cried razumihin he is in an intelligible condition and i see you are an intelligent man too well it s always pleasant to hear words of wisdom that s the gentleman vahrushin afanasy ivanovitch and at the request of your mamma who has sent you a remittance once before in the same manner through him he did not refuse this time also and sent instructions to semyon semyonovitch some days since to hand you thirty five roubles in the hope of better to come that hoping for better to come is the best thing you ve said though your mamma is not bad either come then what do you say is he fully conscious eh that s all right if only he can sign this little paper he can scrawl his name have you got the book yes here s the book give it to me here rodya sit up i ll hold you take the pen and scribble raskolnikov for him for just now brother money is sweeter to us than treacle i don t want it said raskolnikov pushing away the pen not want it i won t sign it how the devil can you do without signing it i don t want the money don t want the money come brother that s nonsense i bear witness don t trouble please it s only that he is on his travels again but that s pretty common with him at all times though you are a man of judgment and we will take him in hand that is more simply take his hand and he will sign it here but i can come another time no no why should we trouble you you are a man of judgment now rodya don t keep your visitor you see he is waiting and he made ready to hold raskolnikov s hand in earnest stop i ll do it alone said the latter taking the pen and signing his name the messenger took out the money and went away bravo and now brother are you hungry yes answered raskolnikov is there any soup some of yesterday s answered nastasya who was still standing there with potatoes and rice in it yes i know it by heart bring soup and give us some tea very well raskolnikov looked at all this with profound astonishment and a dull unreasoning terror he made up his mind to keep quiet and see what would happen i believe i am not wandering i believe it s reality he thought in a couple of minutes nastasya returned with the soup and announced that the tea would be ready directly with the soup she brought two spoons two plates salt pepper mustard for the beef and so on the table was set as it had not been for a long time the cloth was clean it would not be amiss nastasya if praskovya pavlovna were to send us up a couple of bottles of beer we could empty them well you are a cool hand muttered nastasya and she departed to carry out his orders raskolnikov still gazed wildly with strained attention meanwhile razumihin sat down on the sofa beside him as clumsily as a bear put his left arm round raskolnikov s head although he was able to sit up and with his right hand gave him a spoonful of soup blowing on it that it might not burn him but the soup was only just warm raskolnikov swallowed one spoonful greedily then a second then a third but after giving him a few more spoonfuls of soup razumihin suddenly stopped and said that he must ask zossimov whether he ought to have more nastasya came in with two bottles of beer and will you have tea yes cut along nastasya and bring some tea for tea we may venture on without the faculty but here is the beer he moved back to his chair pulled the soup and meat in front of him and began eating as though he had not touched food for three days i must tell you rodya i dine like this here every day now he mumbled with his mouth full of beef and it s all pashenka your dear little landlady who sees to that she loves to do anything for me i don t ask for it but of course i don t object and here s nastasya with the tea she is a quick girl nastasya my dear won t you have some beer get along with your nonsense a cup of tea then a cup of tea maybe pour it out stay i ll pour it out myself sit down he poured out two cups left his dinner and sat on the sofa again as before he put his left arm round the sick man s head raised him up and gave him tea in spoonfuls again blowing each spoonful steadily and earnestly as though this process was the principal and most effective means towards his friend s recovery raskolnikov said nothing and made no resistance though he felt quite strong enough to sit up on the sofa without support and could not merely have held a cup or a spoon but even perhaps could have walked about but from some queer almost animal cunning he conceived the idea of hiding his strength and lying low for a time pretending if necessary not to be yet in full possession of his faculties and meanwhile listening to find out what was going on yet he could not overcome his sense of repugnance after sipping a dozen spoonfuls of tea he suddenly released his head pushed the spoon away capriciously and sank back on the pillow there were actually real pillows under his head now down pillows in clean cases he observed that too and took note of it pashenka must give us some raspberry jam to day to make him some raspberry tea said razumihin going back to his chair and attacking his soup and beer again and where is she to get raspberries for you asked nastasya balancing a saucer on her five outspread fingers and sipping tea through a lump of sugar she ll get it at the shop my dear you see rodya all sorts of things have been happening while you have been laid up when you decamped in that rascally way without leaving your address i felt so angry that i resolved to find you out and punish you i set to work that very day how i ran about making inquiries for you this lodging of yours i had forgotten though i never remembered it indeed because i did not know it and as for your old lodgings i could only remember it was at the five corners harlamov s house i kept trying to find that harlamov s house and afterwards it turned out that it was not harlamov s but buch s how one muddles up sound sometimes so i lost my temper and i went on the chance to the address bureau next day and only fancy in two minutes they looked you up your name is down there my name i should think so and yet a general kobelev they could not find while i was there well it s a long story but as soon as i did land on this place i soon got to know all your affairs all all brother i know everything nastasya here will tell you i made the acquaintance of nikodim fomitch and ilya petrovitch and the house porter and mr zametov alexandr grigorievitch the head clerk in the police office and last but not least of pashenka nastasya here knows he s got round her nastasya murmured smiling slyly why don t you put the sugar in your tea nastasya nikiforovna you are a one nastasya cried suddenly going off into a giggle i am not nikiforovna but petrovna she added suddenly recovering from her mirth i ll make a note of it well brother to make a long story short i was going in for a regular explosion here to uproot all malignant influences in the locality but pashenka won the day i had not expected brother to find her so prepossessing eh what do you think raskolnikov did not speak but he still kept his eyes fixed upon him full of alarm and all that could be wished indeed in every respect razumihin went on not at all embarrassed by his silence ah the sly dog nastasya shrieked again this conversation afforded her unspeakable delight it s a pity brother that you did not set to work in the right way at first you ought to have approached her differently she is so to speak a most unaccountable character but we will talk about her character later how could you let things come to such a pass that she gave up sending you your dinner and that i o u you must have been mad to sign an i o u and that promise of marriage when her daughter natalya yegorovna was alive i know all about it but i see that s a delicate matter and i am an ass forgive me but talking of foolishness do you know praskovya pavlovna is not nearly so foolish as you would think at first sight no mumbled raskolnikov looking away but feeling that it was better to keep up the conversation she isn t is she cried razumihin delighted to get an answer out of him but she is not very clever either eh she is essentially essentially an unaccountable character i am sometimes quite at a loss i assure you she must be forty she says she is thirty six and of course she has every right to say so but i swear i judge her intellectually simply from the metaphysical point of view there is a sort of symbolism sprung up between us a sort of algebra or what not i don t understand it well that s all nonsense only seeing that you are not a student now and have lost your lessons and your clothes and that through the young lady s death she has no need to treat you as a relation she suddenly took fright and as you hid in your den and dropped all your old relations with her she planned to get rid of you and she s been cherishing that design a long time but was sorry to lose the i o u for you assured her yourself that your mother would pay it was base of me to say that my mother herself is almost a beggar and i told a lie to keep my lodging and be fed raskolnikov said loudly and distinctly yes you did very sensibly but the worst of it is that at that point mr tchebarov turns up a business man pashenka would never have thought of doing anything on her own account she is too retiring but the business man is by no means retiring and first thing he puts the question is there any hope of realising the i o u answer there is because he has a mother who would save her rodya with her hundred and twenty five roubles pension if she has to starve herself and a sister too who would go into bondage for his sake that s what he was building upon why do you start i know all the ins and outs of your affairs now my dear boy it s not for nothing that you were so open with pashenka when you were her prospective son in law and i say all this as a friend but i tell you what it is an honest and sensitive man is open and a business man listens and goes on eating you up well then she gave the i o u by way of payment to this tchebarov and without hesitation he made a formal demand for payment when i heard of all this i wanted to blow him up too to clear my conscience but by that time harmony reigned between me and pashenka and i insisted on stopping the whole affair engaging that you would pay i went security for you brother do you understand we called tchebarov flung him ten roubles and got the i o u back from him and here i have the honour of presenting it to you she trusts your word now here take it you see i have torn it razumihin put the note on the table raskolnikov looked at him and turned to the wall without uttering a word even razumihin felt a twinge i see brother he said a moment later that i have been playing the fool again i thought i should amuse you with my chatter and i believe i have only made you cross was it you i did not recognise when i was delirious raskolnikov asked after a moment s pause without turning his head yes and you flew into a rage about it especially when i brought zametov one day zametov the head clerk what for raskolnikov turned round quickly and fixed his eyes on razumihin what s the matter with you what are you upset about he wanted to make your acquaintance because i talked to him a lot about you how could i have found out so much except from him he is a capital fellow brother first rate in his own way of course now we are friends see each other almost every day i have moved into this part you know i have only just moved i ve been with him to luise ivanovna once or twice do you remember luise luise ivanovna did i say anything in delirium i should think so you were beside yourself what did i rave about what next what did you rave about what people do rave about well brother now i must not lose time to work he got up from the table and took up his cap what did i rave about how he keeps on are you afraid of having let out some secret don t worry yourself you said nothing about a countess but you said a lot about a bulldog and about ear rings and chains and about krestovsky island and some porter and nikodim fomitch and ilya petrovitch the assistant superintendent and another thing that was of special interest to you was your own sock you whined give me my sock zametov hunted all about your room for your socks and with his own scented ring bedecked fingers he gave you the rag and only then were you comforted and for the next twenty four hours you held the wretched thing in your hand we could not get it from you it is most likely somewhere under your quilt at this moment and then you asked so piteously for fringe for your trousers we tried to find out what sort of fringe but we could not make it out now to business here are thirty five roubles i take ten of them and shall give you an account of them in an hour or two i will let zossimov know at the same time though he ought to have been here long ago for it is nearly twelve and you nastasya look in pretty often while i am away to see whether he wants a drink or anything else and i will tell pashenka what is wanted myself good bye he calls her pashenka ah he s a deep one said nastasya as he went out then she opened the door and stood listening but could not resist running downstairs after him she was very eager to hear what he would say to the landlady she was evidently quite fascinated by razumihin no sooner had she left the room than the sick man flung off the bedclothes and leapt out of bed like a madman with burning twitching impatience he had waited for them to be gone so that he might set to work but to what work now as though to spite him it eluded him good god only tell me one thing do they know of it yet or not what if they know it and are only pretending mocking me while i am laid up and then they will come in and tell me that it s been discovered long ago and that they have only what am i to do now that s what i ve forgotten as though on purpose forgotten it all at once i remembered a minute ago he stood in the middle of the room and gazed in miserable bewilderment about him he walked to the door opened it listened but that was not what he wanted suddenly as though recalling something he rushed to the corner where there was a hole under the paper began examining it put his hand into the hole fumbled but that was not it he went to the stove opened it and began rummaging in the ashes the frayed edges of his trousers and the rags cut off his pocket were lying there just as he had thrown them no one had looked then then he remembered the sock about which razumihin had just been telling him yes there it lay on the sofa under the quilt but it was so covered with dust and grime that zametov could not have seen anything on it bah zametov the police office and why am i sent for to the police office where s the notice bah i am mixing it up that was then i looked at my sock then too but now now i have been ill but what did zametov come for why did razumihin bring him he muttered helplessly sitting on the sofa again what does it mean am i still in delirium or is it real i believe it is real ah i remember i must escape make haste to escape yes i must i must escape yes but where and where are my clothes i ve no boots they ve taken them away they ve hidden them i understand ah here is my coat they passed that over and here is money on the table thank god and here s the i o u i ll take the money and go and take another lodging they won t find me yes but the address bureau they ll find me razumihin will find me better escape altogether far away to america and let them do their worst and take the i o u it would be of use there what else shall i take they think i am ill they don t know that i can walk ha ha ha i could see by their eyes that they know all about it if only i could get downstairs and what if they have set a watch there policemen what s this tea ah and here is beer left half a bottle cold he snatched up the bottle which still contained a glassful of beer and gulped it down with relish as though quenching a flame in his breast but in another minute the beer had gone to his head and a faint and even pleasant shiver ran down his spine he lay down and pulled the quilt over him his sick and incoherent thoughts grew more and more disconnected and soon a light pleasant drowsiness came upon him with a sense of comfort he nestled his head into the pillow wrapped more closely about him the soft wadded quilt which had replaced the old ragged greatcoat sighed softly and sank into a deep sound refreshing sleep he woke up hearing someone come in he opened his eyes and saw razumihin standing in the doorway uncertain whether to come in or not raskolnikov sat up quickly on the sofa and gazed at him as though trying to recall something ah you are not asleep here i am nastasya bring in the parcel razumihin shouted down the stairs you shall have the account directly what time is it asked raskolnikov looking round uneasily yes you had a fine sleep brother it s almost evening it will be six o clock directly you have slept more than six hours good heavens have i and why not it will do you good what s the hurry a tryst is it we ve all time before us i ve been waiting for the last three hours for you i ve been up twice and found you asleep i ve called on zossimov twice not at home only fancy but no matter he will turn up and i ve been out on my own business too you know i ve been moving to day moving with my uncle i have an uncle living with me now but that s no matter to business give me the parcel nastasya we will open it directly and how do you feel now brother i am quite well i am not ill razumihin have you been here long i tell you i ve been waiting for the last three hours no before how do you mean how long have you been coming here why i told you all about it this morning don t you remember raskolnikov pondered the morning seemed like a dream to him he could not remember alone and looked inquiringly at razumihin hm said the latter he has forgotten i fancied then that you were not quite yourself now you are better for your sleep you really look much better first rate well to business look here my dear boy he began untying the bundle which evidently interested him believe me brother this is something specially near my heart for we must make a man of you let s begin from the top do you see this cap he said taking out of the bundle a fairly good though cheap and ordinary cap let me try it on presently afterwards said raskolnikov waving it off pettishly come rodya my boy don t oppose it afterwards will be too late and i shan t sleep all night for i bought it by guess without measure just right he cried triumphantly fitting it on just your size a proper head covering is the first thing in dress and a recommendation in its own way tolstyakov a friend of mine is always obliged to take off his pudding basin when he goes into any public place where other people wear their hats or caps people think he does it from slavish politeness but it s simply because he is ashamed of his bird s nest he is such a boastful fellow look nastasya here are two specimens of headgear this palmerston he took from the corner raskolnikov s old battered hat which for some unknown reason he called a palmerston or this jewel guess the price rodya what do you suppose i paid for it nastasya he said turning to her seeing that raskolnikov did not speak twenty copecks no more i dare say answered nastasya twenty copecks silly he cried offended why nowadays you would cost more than that eighty copecks and that only because it has been worn and it s bought on condition that when s it s worn out they will give you another next year yes on my word well now let us pass to the united states of america as they called them at school i assure you i am proud of these breeches and he exhibited to raskolnikov a pair of light summer trousers of grey woollen material no holes no spots and quite respectable although a little worn and a waistcoat to match quite in the fashion and its being worn really is an improvement it s softer smoother you see rodya to my thinking the great thing for getting on in the world is always to keep to the seasons if you don t insist on having asparagus in january you keep your money in your purse and it s the same with this purchase it s summer now so i ve been buying summer things warmer materials will be wanted for autumn so you will have to throw these away in any case especially as they will be done for by then from their own lack of coherence if not your higher standard of luxury come price them what do you say two roubles twenty five copecks and remember the condition if you wear these out you will have another suit for nothing they only do business on that system at fedyaev s if you ve bought a thing once you are satisfied for life for you will never go there again of your own free will now for the boots what do you say you see that they are a bit worn but they ll last a couple of months for it s foreign work and foreign leather the secretary of the english embassy sold them last week he had only worn them six days but he was very short of cash price a rouble and a half a bargain but perhaps they won t fit observed nastasya not fit just look and he pulled out of his pocket raskolnikov s old broken boot stiffly coated with dry mud i did not go empty handed they took the size from this monster we all did our best and as to your linen your landlady has seen to that here to begin with are three shirts hempen but with a fashionable front well now then eighty copecks the cap two roubles twenty five copecks the suit together three roubles five copecks a rouble and a half for the boots for you see they are very good and that makes four roubles fifty five copecks five roubles for the underclothes they were bought in the lo which makes exactly nine roubles fifty five copecks forty five copecks change in coppers will you take it and so rodya you are set up with a complete new rig out for your overcoat will serve and even has a style of its own that comes from getting one s clothes from sharmer s as for your socks and other things i leave them to you we ve twenty five roubles left and as for pashenka and paying for your lodging don t you worry i tell you she ll trust you for anything and now brother let me change your linen for i daresay you will throw off your illness with your shirt let me be i don t want to raskolnikov waved him off he had listened with disgust to razumihin s efforts to be playful about his purchases come brother don t tell me i ve been trudging around for nothing razumihin insisted nastasya don t be bashful but help me that s it and in spite of raskolnikov s resistance he changed his linen the latter sank back on the pillows and for a minute or two said nothing it will be long before i get rid of them he thought what money was all that bought with he asked at last gazing at the wall money why your own what the messenger brought from vahrushin your mother sent it have you forgotten that too i remember now said raskolnikov after a long sullen silence razumihin looked at him frowning and uneasy the door opened and a tall stout man whose appearance seemed familiar to raskolnikov came in chapter iv zossimov was a tall fat man with a puffy colourless clean shaven face and straight flaxen hair he wore spectacles and a big gold ring on his fat finger he was twenty seven he had on a light grey fashionable loose coat light summer trousers and everything about him loose fashionable and spick and span his linen was irreproachable his watch chain was massive in manner he was slow and as it were nonchalant and at the same time studiously free and easy he made efforts to conceal his self importance but it was apparent at every instant all his acquaintances found him tedious but said he was clever at his work i ve been to you twice to day brother you see he s come to himself cried razumihin i see i see and how do we feel now eh said zossimov to raskolnikov watching him carefully and sitting down at the foot of the sofa he settled himself as comfortably as he could he is still depressed razumihin went on we ve just changed his linen and he almost cried that s very natural you might have put it off if he did not wish it his pulse is first rate is your head still aching eh i am well i am perfectly well raskolnikov declared positively and irritably he raised himself on the sofa and looked at them with glittering eyes but sank back on to the pillow at once and turned to the wall zossimov watched him intently very good going on all right he said lazily has he eaten anything they told him and asked what he might have he may have anything soup tea mushrooms and cucumbers of course you must not give him he d better not have meat either and but no need to tell you that razumihin and he looked at each other no more medicine or anything i ll look at him again to morrow perhaps to day even but never mind to morrow evening i shall take him for a walk said razumihin we are going to the yusupov garden and then to the palais de crystal i would not disturb him to morrow at all but i don t know a little maybe but we ll see ach what a nuisance i ve got a house warming party to night it s only a step from here couldn t he come he could lie on the sofa you are coming razumihin said to zossimov don t forget you promised all right only rather later what are you going to do oh nothing tea vodka herrings there will be a pie just our friends and who all neighbours here almost all new friends except my old uncle and he is new too he only arrived in petersburg yesterday to see to some business of his we meet once in five years what is he he s been stagnating all his life as a district postmaster gets a little pension he is sixty five not worth talking about but i am fond of him porfiry petrovitch the head of the investigation department here but you know him is he a relation of yours too a very distant one but why are you scowling because you quarrelled once won t you come then i don t care a damn for him so much the better well there will be some students a teacher a government clerk a musician an officer and zametov do tell me please what you or he zossimov nodded at raskolnikov can have in common with this zametov oh you particular gentleman principles you are worked by principles as it were by springs you won t venture to turn round on your own account if a man is a nice fellow that s the only principle i go upon zametov is a delightful person though he does take bribes well he does and what of it i don t care if he does take bribes razumihin cried with unnatural irritability i don t praise him for taking bribes i only say he is a nice man in his own way but if one looks at men in all ways are there many good ones left why i am sure i shouldn t be worth a baked onion myself perhaps with you thrown in that s too little i d give two for you and i wouldn t give more than one for you no more of your jokes zametov is no more than a boy i can pull his hair and one must draw him not repel him you ll never improve a man by repelling him especially a boy one has to be twice as careful with a boy oh you progressive dullards you don t understand you harm yourselves running another man down but if you want to know we really have something in common i should like to know what why it s all about a house painter we are getting him out of a mess though indeed there s nothing to fear now the matter is absolutely self evident we only put on steam a painter why haven t i told you about it i only told you the beginning then about the murder of the old pawnbroker woman well the painter is mixed up in it oh i heard about that murder before and was rather interested in it partly for one reason i read about it in the papers too lizaveta was murdered too nastasya blurted out suddenly addressing raskolnikov she remained in the room all the time standing by the door listening lizaveta murmured raskolnikov hardly audibly lizaveta who sold old clothes didn t you know her she used to come here she mended a shirt for you too raskolnikov turned to the wall where in the dirty yellow paper he picked out one clumsy white flower with brown lines on it and began examining how many petals there were in it how many scallops in the petals and how many lines on them he felt his arms and legs as lifeless as though they had been cut off he did not attempt to move but stared obstinately at the flower but what about the painter zossimov interrupted nastasya s chatter with marked displeasure she sighed and was silent why he was accused of the murder razumihin went on hotly was there evidence against him then evidence indeed evidence that was no evidence and that s what we have to prove it was just as they pitched on those fellows koch and pestryakov at first foo how stupidly it s all done it makes one sick though it s not one s business pestryakov may be coming to night by the way rodya you ve heard about the business already it happened before you were ill the day before you fainted at the police office while they were talking about it zossimov looked curiously at raskolnikov he did not stir but i say razumihin i wonder at you what a busybody you are zossimov observed maybe i am but we will get him off anyway shouted razumihin bringing his fist down on the table what s the most offensive is not their lying one can always forgive lying lying is a delightful thing for it leads to truth what is offensive is that they lie and worship their own lying i respect porfiry but what threw them out at first the door was locked and when they came back with the porter it was open so it followed that koch and pestryakov were the murderers that was their logic but don t excite yourself they simply detained them they could not help that and by the way i ve met that man koch he used to buy unredeemed pledges from the old woman eh yes he is a swindler he buys up bad debts too he makes a profession of it but enough of him do you know what makes me angry it s their sickening rotten petrified routine and this case might be the means of introducing a new method one can show from the psychological data alone how to get on the track of the real man we have facts they say but facts are not everything at least half the business lies in how you interpret them can you interpret them then anyway one can t hold one s tongue when one has a feeling a tangible feeling that one might be a help if only eh do you know the details of the case i am waiting to hear about the painter oh yes well here s the story early on the third day after the murder when they were still dandling koch and pestryakov though they accounted for every step they took and it was as plain as a pikestaff an unexpected fact turned up a peasant called dushkin who keeps a dram shop facing the house brought to the police office a jeweller s case containing some gold ear rings and told a long rigamarole the day before yesterday just after eight o clock mark the day and the hour a journeyman house painter nikolay who had been in to see me already that day brought me this box of gold ear rings and stones and asked me to give him two roubles for them when i asked him where he got them he said that he picked them up in the street i did not ask him anything more i am telling you dushkin s story i gave him a note a rouble that is for i thought if he did not pawn it with me he would with another it would all come to the same thing he d spend it on drink so the thing had better be with me the further you hide it the quicker you will find it and if anything turns up if i hear any rumours i ll take it to the police of course that s all taradiddle he lies like a horse for i know this dushkin he is a pawnbroker and a receiver of stolen goods and he did not cheat nikolay out of a thirty rouble trinket in order to give it to the police he was simply afraid but no matter to return to dushkin s story i ve known this peasant nikolay dementyev from a child he comes from the same province and district of zaraisk we are both ryazan men and though nikolay is not a drunkard he drinks and i knew he had a job in that house painting work with dmitri who comes from the same village too as soon as he got the rouble he changed it had a couple of glasses took his change and went out but i did not see dmitri with him then and the next day i heard that someone had murdered alyona ivanovna and her sister lizaveta ivanovna with an axe i knew them and i felt suspicious about the ear rings at once for i knew the murdered woman lent money on pledges i went to the house and began to make careful inquiries without saying a word to anyone first of all i asked is nikolay here dmitri told me that nikolay had gone off on the spree he had come home at daybreak drunk stayed in the house about ten minutes and went out again dmitri didn t see him again and is finishing the job alone and their job is on the same staircase as the murder on the second floor when i heard all that i did not say a word to anyone that s dushkin s tale but i found out what i could about the murder and went home feeling as suspicious as ever and at eight o clock this morning that was the third day you understand i saw nikolay coming in not sober though not to say very drunk he could understand what was said to him he sat down on the bench and did not speak there was only one stranger in the bar and a man i knew asleep on a bench and our two boys have you seen dmitri said i no i haven t said he and you ve not been here either not since the day before yesterday said he and where did you sleep last night in peski with the kolomensky men and where did you get those ear rings i asked i found them in the street and the way he said it was a bit queer he did not look at me did you hear what happened that very evening at that very hour on that same staircase said i no said he i had not heard and all the while he was listening his eyes were staring out of his head and he turned as white as chalk i told him all about it and he took his hat and began getting up i wanted to keep him wait a bit nikolay said i won t you have a drink and i signed to the boy to hold the door and i came out from behind the bar but he darted out and down the street to the turning at a run i have not seen him since then my doubts were at an end it was his doing as clear as could be i should think so said zossimov wait hear the end of course they sought high and low for nikolay they detained dushkin and searched his house dmitri too was arrested the kolomensky men also were turned inside out and the day before yesterday they arrested nikolay in a tavern at the end of the town he had gone there taken the silver cross off his neck and asked for a dram for it they gave it to him a few minutes afterwards the woman went to the cowshed and through a crack in the wall she saw in the stable adjoining he had made a noose of his sash from the beam stood on a block of wood and was trying to put his neck in the noose the woman screeched her hardest people ran in so that s what you are up to take me he says to such and such a police officer i ll confess everything well they took him to that police station that is here with a suitable escort so they asked him this and that how old he is twenty two and so on at the question when you were working with dmitri didn t you see anyone on the staircase at such and such a time answer to be sure folks may have gone up and down but i did not notice them and didn t you hear anything any noise and so on we heard nothing special and did you hear nikolay that on the same day widow so and so and her sister were murdered and robbed i never knew a thing about it the first i heard of it was from afanasy pavlovitch the day before yesterday and where did you find the ear rings i found them on the pavement why didn t you go to work with dmitri the other day because i was drinking and where were you drinking oh in such and such a place why did you run away from dushkin s because i was awfully frightened what were you frightened of that i should be accused how could you be frightened if you felt free from guilt now zossimov you may not believe me that question was put literally in those words i know it for a fact it was repeated to me exactly what do you say to that well anyway there s the evidence i am not talking of the evidence now i am talking about that question of their own idea of themselves well so they squeezed and squeezed him and he confessed i did not find it in the street but in the flat where i was painting with dmitri and how was that why dmitri and i were painting there all day and we were just getting ready to go and dmitri took a brush and painted my face and he ran off and i after him i ran after him shouting my hardest and at the bottom of the stairs i ran right against the porter and some gentlemen and how many gentlemen were there i don t remember and the porter swore at me and the other porter swore too and the porter s wife came out and swore at us too and a gentleman came into the entry with a lady and he swore at us too for dmitri and i lay right across the way i got hold of dmitri s hair and knocked him down and began beating him and dmitri too caught me by the hair and began beating me but we did it all not for temper but in a friendly way for sport and then dmitri escaped and ran into the street and i ran after him but i did not catch him and went back to the flat alone i had to clear up my things i began putting them together expecting dmitri to come and there in the passage in the corner by the door i stepped on the box i saw it lying there wrapped up in paper i took off the paper saw some little hooks undid them and in the box were the ear rings behind the door lying behind the door behind the door raskolnikov cried suddenly staring with a blank look of terror at razumihin and he slowly sat up on the sofa leaning on his hand yes why what s the matter what s wrong razumihin too got up from his seat nothing raskolnikov answered faintly turning to the wall all were silent for a while he must have waked from a dream razumihin said at last looking inquiringly at zossimov the latter slightly shook his head well go on said zossimov what next what next as soon as he saw the ear rings forgetting dmitri and everything he took up his cap and ran to dushkin and as we know got a rouble from him he told a lie saying he found them in the street and went off drinking he keeps repeating his old story about the murder i know nothing of it never heard of it till the day before yesterday and why didn t you come to the police till now i was frightened and why did you try to hang yourself from anxiety what anxiety that i should be accused of it well that s the whole story and now what do you suppose they deduced from that why there s no supposing there s a clue such as it is a fact you wouldn t have your painter set free now they ve simply taken him for the murderer they haven t a shadow of doubt that s nonsense you are excited but what about the ear rings you must admit that if on the very same day and hour ear rings from the old woman s box have come into nikolay s hands they must have come there somehow that s a good deal in such a case how did they get there how did they get there cried razumihin how can you a doctor whose duty it is to study man and who has more opportunity than anyone else for studying human nature how can you fail to see the character of the man in the whole story don t you see at once that the answers he has given in the examination are the holy truth they came into his hand precisely as he has told us he stepped on the box and picked it up the holy truth but didn t he own himself that he told a lie at first listen to me listen attentively the porter and koch and pestryakov and the other porter and the wife of the first porter and the woman who was sitting in the porter s lodge and the man kryukov who had just got out of a cab at that minute and went in at the entry with a lady on his arm that is eight or ten witnesses agree that nikolay had dmitri on the ground was lying on him beating him while dmitri hung on to his hair beating him too they lay right across the way blocking the thoroughfare they were sworn at on all sides while they like children the very words of the witnesses were falling over one another squealing fighting and laughing with the funniest faces and chasing one another like children they ran into the street now take careful note the bodies upstairs were warm you understand warm when they found them if they or nikolay alone had murdered them and broken open the boxes or simply taken part in the robbery allow me to ask you one question do their state of mind their squeals and giggles and childish scuffling at the gate fit in with axes bloodshed fiendish cunning robbery they d just killed them not five or ten minutes before for the bodies were still warm and at once leaving the flat open knowing that people would go there at once flinging away their booty they rolled about like children laughing and attracting general attention and there are a dozen witnesses to swear to that of course it is strange it s impossible indeed but no brother no buts and if the ear rings being found in nikolay s hands at the very day and hour of the murder constitutes an important piece of circumstantial evidence against him although the explanation given by him accounts for it and therefore it does not tell seriously against him one must take into consideration the facts which prove him innocent especially as they are facts that cannot be denied and do you suppose from the character of our legal system that they will accept or that they are in a position to accept this fact resting simply on a psychological impossibility as irrefutable and conclusively breaking down the circumstantial evidence for the prosecution no they won t accept it they certainly won t because they found the jewel case and the man tried to hang himself which he could not have done if he hadn t felt guilty that s the point that s what excites me you must understand oh i see you are excited wait a bit i forgot to ask you what proof is there that the box came from the old woman that s been proved said razumihin with apparent reluctance frowning koch recognised the jewel case and gave the name of the owner who proved conclusively that it was his that s bad now another point did anyone see nikolay at the time that koch and pestryakov were going upstairs at first and is there no evidence about that nobody did see him razumihin answered with vexation that s the worst of it even koch and pestryakov did not notice them on their way upstairs though indeed their evidence could not have been worth much they said they saw the flat was open and that there must be work going on in it but they took no special notice and could not remember whether there actually were men at work in it hm so the only evidence for the defence is that they were beating one another and laughing that constitutes a strong presumption but how do you explain the facts yourself how do i explain them what is there to explain it s clear at any rate the direction in which explanation is to be sought is clear and the jewel case points to it the real murderer dropped those ear rings the murderer was upstairs locked in when koch and pestryakov knocked at the door koch like an ass did not stay at the door so the murderer popped out and ran down too for he had no other way of escape he hid from koch pestryakov and the porter in the flat when nikolay and dmitri had just run out of it he stopped there while the porter and others were going upstairs waited till they were out of hearing and then went calmly downstairs at the very minute when dmitri and nikolay ran out into the street and there was no one in the entry possibly he was seen but not noticed there are lots of people going in and out he must have dropped the ear rings out of his pocket when he stood behind the door and did not notice he dropped them because he had other things to think of the jewel case is a conclusive proof that he did stand there that s how i explain it too clever no my boy you re too clever that beats everything but why why why because everything fits too well it s too melodramatic a ach razumihin was exclaiming but at that moment the door opened and a personage came in who was a stranger to all present chapter v this was a gentleman no longer young of a stiff and portly appearance and a cautious and sour countenance he began by stopping short in the doorway staring about him with offensive and undisguised astonishment as though asking himself what sort of place he had come to mistrustfully and with an affectation of being alarmed and almost affronted he scanned raskolnikov s low and narrow cabin with the same amazement he stared at raskolnikov who lay undressed dishevelled unwashed on his miserable dirty sofa looking fixedly at him then with the same deliberation he scrutinised the uncouth unkempt figure and unshaven face of razumihin who looked him boldly and inquiringly in the face without rising from his seat a constrained silence lasted for a couple of minutes and then as might be expected some scene shifting took place reflecting probably from certain fairly unmistakable signs that he would get nothing in this cabin by attempting to overawe them the gentleman softened somewhat and civilly though with some severity emphasising every syllable of his question addressed zossimov rodion romanovitch raskolnikov a student or formerly a student zossimov made a slight movement and would have answered had not razumihin anticipated him here he is lying on the sofa what do you want this familiar what do you want seemed to cut the ground from the feet of the pompous gentleman he was turning to razumihin but checked himself in time and turned to zossimov again this is raskolnikov mumbled zossimov nodding towards him then he gave a prolonged yawn opening his mouth as wide as possible then he lazily put his hand into his waistcoat pocket pulled out a huge gold watch in a round hunter s case opened it looked at it and as slowly and lazily proceeded to put it back raskolnikov himself lay without speaking on his back gazing persistently though without understanding at the stranger now that his face was turned away from the strange flower on the paper it was extremely pale and wore a look of anguish as though he had just undergone an agonising operation or just been taken from the rack but the new comer gradually began to arouse his attention then his wonder then suspicion and even alarm when zossimov said this is raskolnikov he jumped up quickly sat on the sofa and with an almost defiant but weak and breaking voice articulated yes i am raskolnikov what do you want the visitor scrutinised him and pronounced impressively pyotr petrovitch luzhin i believe i have reason to hope that my name is not wholly unknown to you but raskolnikov who had expected something quite different gazed blankly and dreamily at him making no reply as though he heard the name of pyotr petrovitch for the first time is it possible that you can up to the present have received no information asked pyotr petrovitch somewhat disconcerted in reply raskolnikov sank languidly back on the pillow put his hands behind his head and gazed at the ceiling a look of dismay came into luzhin s face zossimov and razumihin stared at him more inquisitively than ever and at last he showed unmistakable signs of embarrassment i had presumed and calculated he faltered that a letter posted more than ten days if not a fortnight ago i say why are you standing in the doorway razumihin interrupted suddenly if you ve something to say sit down nastasya and you are so crowded nastasya make room here s a chair thread your way in he moved his chair back from the table made a little space between the table and his knees and waited in a rather cramped position for the visitor to thread his way in the minute was so chosen that it was impossible to refuse and the visitor squeezed his way through hurrying and stumbling reaching the chair he sat down looking suspiciously at razumihin no need to be nervous the latter blurted out rodya has been ill for the last five days and delirious for three but now he is recovering and has got an appetite this is his doctor who has just had a look at him i am a comrade of rodya s like him formerly a student and now i am nursing him so don t you take any notice of us but go on with your business thank you but shall i not disturb the invalid by my presence and conversation pyotr petrovitch asked of zossimov n no mumbled zossimov you may amuse him he yawned again he has been conscious a long time since the morning went on razumihin whose familiarity seemed so much like unaffected good nature that pyotr petrovitch began to be more cheerful partly perhaps because this shabby and impudent person had introduced himself as a student your mamma began luzhin hm razumihin cleared his throat loudly luzhin looked at him inquiringly that s all right go on luzhin shrugged his shoulders your mamma had commenced a letter to you while i was sojourning in her neighbourhood on my arrival here i purposely allowed a few days to elapse before coming to see you in order that i might be fully assured that you were in full possession of the tidings but now to my astonishment i know i know raskolnikov cried suddenly with impatient vexation so you are the fiance i know and that s enough there was no doubt about pyotr petrovitch s being offended this time but he said nothing he made a violent effort to understand what it all meant there was a moment s silence meanwhile raskolnikov who had turned a little towards him when he answered began suddenly staring at him again with marked curiosity as though he had not had a good look at him yet or as though something new had struck him he rose from his pillow on purpose to stare at him there certainly was something peculiar in pyotr petrovitch s whole appearance something which seemed to justify the title of fiance so unceremoniously applied to him in the first place it was evident far too much so indeed that pyotr petrovitch had made eager use of his few days in the capital to get himself up and rig himself out in expectation of his betrothed a perfectly innocent and permissible proceeding indeed even his own perhaps too complacent consciousness of the agreeable improvement in his appearance might have been forgiven in such circumstances seeing that pyotr petrovitch had taken up the role of fiance all his clothes were fresh from the tailor s and were all right except for being too new and too distinctly appropriate even the stylish new round hat had the same significance pyotr petrovitch treated it too respectfully and held it too carefully in his hands the exquisite pair of lavender gloves real louvain told the same tale if only from the fact of his not wearing them but carrying them in his hand for show light and youthful colours predominated in pyotr petrovitch s attire he wore a charming summer jacket of a fawn shade light thin trousers a waistcoat of the same new and fine linen a cravat of the lightest cambric with pink stripes on it and the best of it was this all suited pyotr petrovitch his very fresh and even handsome face looked younger than his forty five years at all times his dark mutton chop whiskers made an agreeable setting on both sides growing thickly upon his shining clean shaven chin even his hair touched here and there with grey though it had been combed and curled at a hairdresser s did not give him a stupid appearance as curled hair usually does by inevitably suggesting a german on his wedding day if there really was something unpleasing and repulsive in his rather good looking and imposing countenance it was due to quite other causes after scanning mr luzhin unceremoniously raskolnikov smiled malignantly sank back on the pillow and stared at the ceiling as before but mr luzhin hardened his heart and seemed to determine to take no notice of their oddities i feel the greatest regret at finding you in this situation he began again breaking the silence with an effort if i had been aware of your illness i should have come earlier but you know what business is i have too a very important legal affair in the senate not to mention other preoccupations which you may well conjecture i am expecting your mamma and sister any minute raskolnikov made a movement and seemed about to speak his face showed some excitement pyotr petrovitch paused waited but as nothing followed he went on any minute i have found a lodging for them on their arrival where asked raskolnikov weakly very near here in bakaleyev s house that s in voskresensky put in razumihin there are two storeys of rooms let by a merchant called yushin i ve been there yes rooms a disgusting place filthy stinking and what s more of doubtful character things have happened there and there are all sorts of queer people living there and i went there about a scandalous business it s cheap though i could not of course find out so much about it for i am a stranger in petersburg myself pyotr petrovitch replied huffily however the two rooms are exceedingly clean and as it is for so short a time i have already taken a permanent that is our future flat he said addressing raskolnikov and i am having it done up and meanwhile i am myself cramped for room in a lodging with my friend andrey semyonovitch lebeziatnikov in the flat of madame lippevechsel it was he who told me of bakaleyev s house too lebeziatnikov said raskolnikov slowly as if recalling something yes andrey semyonovitch lebeziatnikov a clerk in the ministry do you know him yes no raskolnikov answered excuse me i fancied so from your inquiry i was once his guardian a very nice young man and advanced i like to meet young people one learns new things from them luzhin looked round hopefully at them all how do you mean asked razumihin in the most serious and essential matters pyotr petrovitch replied as though delighted at the question you see it s ten years since i visited petersburg all the novelties reforms ideas have reached us in the provinces but to see it all more clearly one must be in petersburg and it s my notion that you observe and learn most by watching the younger generation and i confess i am delighted at what your question is a wide one i may be mistaken but i fancy i find clearer views more so to say criticism more practicality that s true zossimov let drop nonsense there s no practicality razumihin flew at him practicality is a difficult thing to find it does not drop down from heaven and for the last two hundred years we have been divorced from all practical life ideas if you like are fermenting he said to pyotr petrovitch and desire for good exists though it s in a childish form and honesty you may find although there are crowds of brigands anyway there s no practicality practicality goes well shod i don t agree with you pyotr petrovitch replied with evident enjoyment of course people do get carried away and make mistakes but one must have indulgence those mistakes are merely evidence of enthusiasm for the cause and of abnormal external environment if little has been done the time has been but short of means i will not speak it s my personal view if you care to know that something has been accomplished already new valuable ideas new valuable works are circulating in the place of our old dreamy and romantic authors literature is taking a maturer form many injurious prejudice have been rooted up and turned into ridicule in a word we have cut ourselves off irrevocably from the past and that to my thinking is a great thing he s learnt it by heart to show off raskolnikov pronounced suddenly what asked pyotr petrovitch not catching his words but he received no reply that s all true zossimov hastened to interpose isn t it so pyotr petrovitch went on glancing affably at zossimov you must admit he went on addressing razumihin with a shade of triumph and superciliousness he almost added young man that there is an advance or as they say now progress in the name of science and economic truth a commonplace no not a commonplace hitherto for instance if i were told love thy neighbour what came of it pyotr petrovitch went on perhaps with excessive haste it came to my tearing my coat in half to share with my neighbour and we both were left half naked as a russian proverb has it catch several hares and you won t catch one science now tells us love yourself before all men for everything in the world rests on self interest you love yourself and manage your own affairs properly and your coat remains whole economic truth adds that the better private affairs are organised in society the more whole coats so to say the firmer are its foundations and the better is the common welfare organised too therefore in acquiring wealth solely and exclusively for myself i am acquiring so to speak for all and helping to bring to pass my neighbour s getting a little more than a torn coat and that not from private personal liberality but as a consequence of the general advance the idea is simple but unhappily it has been a long time reaching us being hindered by idealism and sentimentality and yet it would seem to want very little wit to perceive it excuse me i ve very little wit myself razumihin cut in sharply and so let us drop it i began this discussion with an object but i ve grown so sick during the last three years of this chattering to amuse oneself of this incessant flow of commonplaces always the same that by jove i blush even when other people talk like that you are in a hurry no doubt to exhibit your acquirements and i don t blame you that s quite pardonable i only wanted to find out what sort of man you are for so many unscrupulous people have got hold of the progressive cause of late and have so distorted in their own interests everything they touched that the whole cause has been dragged in the mire that s enough excuse me sir said luzhin affronted and speaking with excessive dignity do you mean to suggest so unceremoniously that i too oh my dear sir how could i come that s enough razumihin concluded and he turned abruptly to zossimov to continue their previous conversation pyotr petrovitch had the good sense to accept the disavowal he made up his mind to take leave in another minute or two i trust our acquaintance he said addressing raskolnikov may upon your recovery and in view of the circumstances of which you are aware become closer above all i hope for your return to health raskolnikov did not even turn his head pyotr petrovitch began getting up from his chair one of her customers must have killed her zossimov declared positively not a doubt of it replied razumihin porfiry doesn t give his opinion but is examining all who have left pledges with her there examining them raskolnikov asked aloud yes what then nothing how does he get hold of them asked zossimov koch has given the names of some of them other names are on the wrappers of the pledges and some have come forward of themselves it must have been a cunning and practised ruffian the boldness of it the coolness that s just what it wasn t interposed razumihin that s what throws you all off the scent but i maintain that he is not cunning not practised and probably this was his first crime the supposition that it was a calculated crime and a cunning criminal doesn t work suppose him to have been inexperienced and it s clear that it was only a chance that saved him and chance may do anything why he did not foresee obstacles perhaps and how did he set to work he took jewels worth ten or twenty roubles stuffing his pockets with them ransacked the old woman s trunks her rags and they found fifteen hundred roubles besides notes in a box in the top drawer of the chest he did not know how to rob he could only murder it was his first crime i assure you his first crime he lost his head and he got off more by luck than good counsel you are talking of the murder of the old pawnbroker i believe pyotr petrovitch put in addressing zossimov he was standing hat and gloves in hand but before departing he felt disposed to throw off a few more intellectual phrases he was evidently anxious to make a favourable impression and his vanity overcame his prudence yes you ve heard of it oh yes being in the neighbourhood do you know the details i can t say that but another circumstance interests me in the case the whole question so to say not to speak of the fact that crime has been greatly on the increase among the lower classes during the last five years not to speak of the cases of robbery and arson everywhere what strikes me as the strangest thing is that in the higher classes too crime is increasing proportionately in one place one hears of a student s robbing the mail on the high road in another place people of good social position forge false banknotes in moscow of late a whole gang has been captured who used to forge lottery tickets and one of the ringleaders was a lecturer in universal history then our secretary abroad was murdered from some obscure motive of gain and if this old woman the pawnbroker has been murdered by someone of a higher class in society for peasants don t pawn gold trinkets how are we to explain this demoralisation of the civilised part of our society there are many economic changes put in zossimov how are we to explain it razumihin caught him up it might be explained by our inveterate impracticality how do you mean what answer had your lecturer in moscow to make to the question why he was forging notes everybody is getting rich one way or another so i want to make haste to get rich too i don t remember the exact words but the upshot was that he wants money for nothing without waiting or working we ve grown used to having everything ready made to walking on crutches to having our food chewed for us then the great hour struck and every man showed himself in his true colours the emancipation of the serfs in is meant translator s note but morality and so to speak principles but why do you worry about it raskolnikov interposed suddenly it s in accordance with your theory in accordance with my theory why carry out logically the theory you were advocating just now and it follows that people may be killed upon my word cried luzhin no that s not so put in zossimov raskolnikov lay with a white face and twitching upper lip breathing painfully there s a measure in all things luzhin went on superciliously economic ideas are not an incitement to murder and one has but to suppose and is it true raskolnikov interposed once more suddenly again in a voice quivering with fury and delight in insulting him is it true that you told your fiancee within an hour of her acceptance that what pleased you most was that she was a beggar because it was better to raise a wife from poverty so that you may have complete control over her and reproach her with your being her benefactor upon my word luzhin cried wrathfully and irritably crimson with confusion to distort my words in this way excuse me allow me to assure you that the report which has reached you or rather let me say has been conveyed to you has no foundation in truth and i suspect who in a word this arrow in a word your mamma she seemed to me in other things with all her excellent qualities of a somewhat high flown and romantic way of thinking but i was a thousand miles from supposing that she would misunderstand and misrepresent things in so fanciful a way and indeed indeed i tell you what cried raskolnikov raising himself on his pillow and fixing his piercing glittering eyes upon him i tell you what what luzhin stood still waiting with a defiant and offended face silence lasted for some seconds why if ever again you dare to mention a single word about my mother i shall send you flying downstairs what s the matter with you cried razumihin so that s how it is luzhin turned pale and bit his lip let me tell you sir he began deliberately doing his utmost to restrain himself but breathing hard at the first moment i saw you you were ill disposed to me but i remained here on purpose to find out more i could forgive a great deal in a sick man and a connection but you never after this i am not ill cried raskolnikov so much the worse go to hell but luzhin was already leaving without finishing his speech squeezing between the table and the chair razumihin got up this time to let him pass without glancing at anyone and not even nodding to zossimov who had for some time been making signs to him to let the sick man alone he went out lifting his hat to the level of his shoulders to avoid crushing it as he stooped to go out of the door and even the curve of his spine was expressive of the horrible insult he had received how could you how could you razumihin said shaking his head in perplexity let me alone let me alone all of you raskolnikov cried in a frenzy will you ever leave off tormenting me i am not afraid of you i am not afraid of anyone anyone now get away from me i want to be alone alone alone come along said zossimov nodding to razumihin but we can t leave him like this come along zossimov repeated insistently and he went out razumihin thought a minute and ran to overtake him it might be worse not to obey him said zossimov on the stairs he mustn t be irritated what s the matter with him if only he could get some favourable shock that s what would do it at first he was better you know he has got something on his mind some fixed idea weighing on him i am very much afraid so he must have perhaps it s that gentleman pyotr petrovitch from his conversation i gather he is going to marry his sister and that he had received a letter about it just before his illness yes confound the man he may have upset the case altogether but have you noticed he takes no interest in anything he does not respond to anything except one point on which he seems excited that s the murder yes yes razumihin agreed i noticed that too he is interested frightened it gave him a shock on the day he was ill in the police office he fainted tell me more about that this evening and i ll tell you something afterwards he interests me very much in half an hour i ll go and see him again there ll be no inflammation though thanks and i ll wait with pashenka meantime and will keep watch on him through nastasya raskolnikov left alone looked with impatience and misery at nastasya but she still lingered won t you have some tea now she asked later i am sleepy leave me he turned abruptly to the wall nastasya went out chapter vi but as soon as she went out he got up latched the door undid the parcel which razumihin had brought in that evening and had tied up again and began dressing strange to say he seemed immediately to have become perfectly calm not a trace of his recent delirium nor of the panic fear that had haunted him of late it was the first moment of a strange sudden calm his movements were precise and definite a firm purpose was evident in them to day to day he muttered to himself he understood that he was still weak but his intense spiritual concentration gave him strength and self confidence he hoped moreover that he would not fall down in the street when he had dressed in entirely new clothes he looked at the money lying on the table and after a moment s thought put it in his pocket it was twenty five roubles he took also all the copper change from the ten roubles spent by razumihin on the clothes then he softly unlatched the door went out slipped downstairs and glanced in at the open kitchen door nastasya was standing with her back to him blowing up the landlady s samovar she heard nothing who would have dreamed of his going out indeed a minute later he was in the street it was nearly eight o clock the sun was setting it was as stifling as before but he eagerly drank in the stinking dusty town air his head felt rather dizzy a sort of savage energy gleamed suddenly in his feverish eyes and his wasted pale and yellow face he did not know and did not think where he was going he had one thought only that all this must be ended to day once for all immediately that he would not return home without it because he would not go on living like that how with what to make an end he had not an idea about it he did not even want to think of it he drove away thought thought tortured him all he knew all he felt was that everything must be changed one way or another he repeated with desperate and immovable self confidence and determination from old habit he took his usual walk in the direction of the hay market a dark haired young man with a barrel organ was standing in the road in front of a little general shop and was grinding out a very sentimental song he was accompanying a girl of fifteen who stood on the pavement in front of him she was dressed up in a crinoline a mantle and a straw hat with a flame coloured feather in it all very old and shabby in a strong and rather agreeable voice cracked and coarsened by street singing she sang in hope of getting a copper from the shop raskolnikov joined two or three listeners took out a five copeck piece and put it in the girl s hand she broke off abruptly on a sentimental high note shouted sharply to the organ grinder come on and both moved on to the next shop do you like street music said raskolnikov addressing a middle aged man standing idly by him the man looked at him startled and wondering i love to hear singing to a street organ said raskolnikov and his manner seemed strangely out of keeping with the subject i like it on cold dark damp autumn evenings they must be damp when all the passers by have pale green sickly faces or better still when wet snow is falling straight down when there s no wind you know what i mean and the street lamps shine through it i don t know excuse me muttered the stranger frightened by the question and raskolnikov s strange manner and he crossed over to the other side of the street raskolnikov walked straight on and came out at the corner of the hay market where the huckster and his wife had talked with lizaveta but they were not there now recognising the place he stopped looked round and addressed a young fellow in a red shirt who stood gaping before a corn chandler s shop isn t there a man who keeps a booth with his wife at this corner all sorts of people keep booths here answered the young man glancing superciliously at raskolnikov what s his name what he was christened aren t you a zaraisky man too which province the young man looked at raskolnikov again it s not a province your excellency but a district graciously forgive me your excellency is that a tavern at the top there yes it s an eating house and there s a billiard room and you ll find princesses there too la la raskolnikov crossed the square in that corner there was a dense crowd of peasants he pushed his way into the thickest part of it looking at the faces he felt an unaccountable inclination to enter into conversation with people but the peasants took no notice of him they were all shouting in groups together he stood and thought a little and took a turning to the right in the direction of v he had often crossed that little street which turns at an angle leading from the market place to sadovy street of late he had often felt drawn to wander about this district when he felt depressed that he might feel more so now he walked along thinking of nothing at that point there is a great block of buildings entirely let out in dram shops and eating houses women were continually running in and out bare headed and in their indoor clothes here and there they gathered in groups on the pavement especially about the entrances to various festive establishments in the lower storeys from one of these a loud din sounds of singing the tinkling of a guitar and shouts of merriment floated into the street a crowd of women were thronging round the door some were sitting on the steps others on the pavement others were standing talking a drunken soldier smoking a cigarette was walking near them in the road swearing he seemed to be trying to find his way somewhere but had forgotten where one beggar was quarrelling with another and a man dead drunk was lying right across the road raskolnikov joined the throng of women who were talking in husky voices they were bare headed and wore cotton dresses and goatskin shoes there were women of forty and some not more than seventeen almost all had blackened eyes he felt strangely attracted by the singing and all the noise and uproar in the saloon below someone could be heard within dancing frantically marking time with his heels to the sounds of the guitar and of a thin falsetto voice singing a jaunty air he listened intently gloomily and dreamily bending down at the entrance and peeping inquisitively in from the pavement oh my handsome soldier don t beat me for nothing trilled the thin voice of the singer raskolnikov felt a great desire to make out what he was singing as though everything depended on that shall i go in he thought they are laughing from drink shall i get drunk won t you come in one of the women asked him her voice was still musical and less thick than the others she was young and not repulsive the only one of the group why she s pretty he said drawing himself up and looking at her she smiled much pleased at the compliment you re very nice looking yourself she said isn t he thin though observed another woman in a deep bass have you just come out of a hospital they re all generals daughters it seems but they have all snub noses interposed a tipsy peasant with a sly smile on his face wearing a loose coat see how jolly they are go along with you i ll go sweetie and he darted down into the saloon below raskolnikov moved on i say sir the girl shouted after him what is it she hesitated i ll always be pleased to spend an hour with you kind gentleman but now i feel shy give me six copecks for a drink there s a nice young man raskolnikov gave her what came first fifteen copecks ah what a good natured gentleman what s your name ask for duclida well that s too much one of the women observed shaking her head at duclida i don t know how you can ask like that i believe i should drop with shame raskolnikov looked curiously at the speaker she was a pock marked wench of thirty covered with bruises with her upper lip swollen she made her criticism quietly and earnestly where is it thought raskolnikov where is it i ve read that someone condemned to death says or thinks an hour before his death that if he had to live on some high rock on such a narrow ledge that he d only room to stand and the ocean everlasting darkness everlasting solitude everlasting tempest around him if he had to remain standing on a square yard of space all his life a thousand years eternity it were better to live so than to die at once only to live to live and live life whatever it may be how true it is good god how true man is a vile creature and vile is he who calls him vile for that he added a moment later he went into another street bah the palais de cristal razumihin was just talking of the palais de cristal but what on earth was it i wanted yes the newspapers zossimov said he d read it in the papers have you the papers he asked going into a very spacious and positively clean restaurant consisting of several rooms which were however rather empty two or three people were drinking tea and in a room further away were sitting four men drinking champagne raskolnikov fancied that zametov was one of them but he could not be sure at that distance what if it is he thought will you have vodka asked the waiter give me some tea and bring me the papers the old ones for the last five days and i ll give you something yes sir here s to day s no vodka the old newspapers and the tea were brought raskolnikov sat down and began to look through them oh damn these are the items of intelligence an accident on a staircase spontaneous combustion of a shopkeeper from alcohol a fire in peski a fire in the petersburg quarter another fire in the petersburg quarter and another fire in the petersburg quarter ah here it is he found at last what he was seeking and began to read it the lines danced before his eyes but he read it all and began eagerly seeking later additions in the following numbers his hands shook with nervous impatience as he turned the sheets suddenly someone sat down beside him at his table he looked up it was the head clerk zametov looking just the same with the rings on his fingers and the watch chain with the curly black hair parted and pomaded with the smart waistcoat rather shabby coat and doubtful linen he was in a good humour at least he was smiling very gaily and good humouredly his dark face was rather flushed from the champagne he had drunk what you here he began in surprise speaking as though he d known him all his life why razumihin told me only yesterday you were unconscious how strange and do you know i ve been to see you raskolnikov knew he would come up to him he laid aside the papers and turned to zametov there was a smile on his lips and a new shade of irritable impatience was apparent in that smile i know you have he answered i ve heard it you looked for my sock and you know razumihin has lost his heart to you he says you ve been with him to luise ivanovna s you know the woman you tried to befriend for whom you winked to the explosive lieutenant and he would not understand do you remember how could he fail to understand it was quite clear wasn t it what a hot head he is the explosive one no your friend razumihin you must have a jolly life mr zametov entrance free to the most agreeable places who s been pouring champagne into you just now we ve just been having a drink together you talk about pouring it into me by way of a fee you profit by everything raskolnikov laughed it s all right my dear boy he added slapping zametov on the shoulder i am not speaking from temper but in a friendly way for sport as that workman of yours said when he was scuffling with dmitri in the case of the old woman how do you know about it perhaps i know more about it than you do how strange you are i am sure you are still very unwell you oughtn t to have come out oh do i seem strange to you yes what are you doing reading the papers yes there s a lot about the fires no i am not reading about the fires here he looked mysteriously at zametov his lips were twisted again in a mocking smile no i am not reading about the fires he went on winking at zametov but confess now my dear fellow you re awfully anxious to know what i am reading about i am not in the least mayn t i ask a question why do you keep on listen you are a man of culture and education i was in the sixth class at the gymnasium said zametov with some dignity sixth class ah my cock sparrow with your parting and your rings you are a gentleman of fortune foo what a charming boy here raskolnikov broke into a nervous laugh right in zametov s face the latter drew back more amazed than offended foo how strange you are zametov repeated very seriously i can t help thinking you are still delirious i am delirious you are fibbing my cock sparrow so i am strange you find me curious do you yes curious shall i tell you what i was reading about what i was looking for see what a lot of papers i ve made them bring me suspicious eh well what is it you prick up your ears how do you mean prick up my ears i ll explain that afterwards but now my boy i declare to you no better i confess no that s not right either i make a deposition and you take it i depose that i was reading that i was looking and searching he screwed up his eyes and paused i was searching and came here on purpose to do it for news of the murder of the old pawnbroker woman he articulated at last almost in a whisper bringing his face exceedingly close to the face of zametov zametov looked at him steadily without moving or drawing his face away what struck zametov afterwards as the strangest part of it all was that silence followed for exactly a minute and that they gazed at one another all the while what if you have been reading about it he cried at last perplexed and impatient that s no business of mine what of it the same old woman raskolnikov went on in the same whisper not heeding zametov s explanation about whom you were talking in the police office you remember when i fainted well do you understand now what do you mean understand what zametov brought out almost alarmed raskolnikov s set and earnest face was suddenly transformed and he suddenly went off into the same nervous laugh as before as though utterly unable to restrain himself and in one flash he recalled with extraordinary vividness of sensation a moment in the recent past that moment when he stood with the axe behind the door while the latch trembled and the men outside swore and shook it and he had a sudden desire to shout at them to swear at them to put out his tongue at them to mock them to laugh and laugh and laugh you are either mad or began zametov and he broke off as though stunned by the idea that had suddenly flashed into his mind or or what what come tell me nothing said zametov getting angry it s all nonsense both were silent after his sudden fit of laughter raskolnikov became suddenly thoughtful and melancholy he put his elbow on the table and leaned his head on his hand he seemed to have completely forgotten zametov the silence lasted for some time why don t you drink your tea it s getting cold said zametov what tea oh yes raskolnikov sipped the glass put a morsel of bread in his mouth and suddenly looking at zametov seemed to remember everything and pulled himself together at the same moment his face resumed its original mocking expression he went on drinking tea there have been a great many of these crimes lately said zametov only the other day i read in the moscow news that a whole gang of false coiners had been caught in moscow it was a regular society they used to forge tickets oh but it was a long time ago i read about it a month ago raskolnikov answered calmly so you consider them criminals he added smiling of course they are criminals they they are children simpletons not criminals why half a hundred people meeting for such an object what an idea three would be too many and then they want to have more faith in one another than in themselves one has only to blab in his cups and it all collapses simpletons they engaged untrustworthy people to change the notes what a thing to trust to a casual stranger well let us suppose that these simpletons succeed and each makes a million and what follows for the rest of their lives each is dependent on the others for the rest of his life better hang oneself at once and they did not know how to change the notes either the man who changed the notes took five thousand roubles and his hands trembled he counted the first four thousand but did not count the fifth thousand he was in such a hurry to get the money into his pocket and run away of course he roused suspicion and the whole thing came to a crash through one fool is it possible that his hands trembled observed zametov yes that s quite possible that i feel quite sure is possible sometimes one can t stand things can t stand that why could you stand it then no i couldn t for the sake of a hundred roubles to face such a terrible experience to go with false notes into a bank where it s their business to spot that sort of thing no i should not have the face to do it would you raskolnikov had an intense desire again to put his tongue out shivers kept running down his spine i should do it quite differently raskolnikov began this is how i would change the notes i d count the first thousand three or four times backwards and forwards looking at every note and then i d set to the second thousand i d count that half way through and then hold some fifty rouble note to the light then turn it then hold it to the light again to see whether it was a good one i am afraid i would say a relation of mine lost twenty five roubles the other day through a false note and then i d tell them the whole story and after i began counting the third no excuse me i would say i fancy i made a mistake in the seventh hundred in that second thousand i am not sure and so i would give up the third thousand and go back to the second and so on to the end and when i had finished i d pick out one from the fifth and one from the second thousand and take them again to the light and ask again change them please and put the clerk into such a stew that he would not know how to get rid of me when i d finished and had gone out i d come back no excuse me and ask for some explanation that s how i d do it foo what terrible things you say said zametov laughing but all that is only talk i dare say when it came to deeds you d make a slip i believe that even a practised desperate man cannot always reckon on himself much less you and i to take an example near home that old woman murdered in our district the murderer seems to have been a desperate fellow he risked everything in open daylight was saved by a miracle but his hands shook too he did not succeed in robbing the place he couldn t stand it that was clear from the raskolnikov seemed offended clear why don t you catch him then he cried maliciously gibing at zametov well they will catch him who you do you suppose you could catch him you ve a tough job a great point for you is whether a man is spending money or not if he had no money and suddenly begins spending he must be the man so that any child can mislead you the fact is they always do that though answered zametov a man will commit a clever murder at the risk of his life and then at once he goes drinking in a tavern they are caught spending money they are not all as cunning as you are you wouldn t go to a tavern of course raskolnikov frowned and looked steadily at zametov you seem to enjoy the subject and would like to know how i should behave in that case too he asked with displeasure i should like to zametov answered firmly and seriously somewhat too much earnestness began to appear in his words and looks very much very much all right then this is how i should behave raskolnikov began again bringing his face close to zametov s again staring at him and speaking in a whisper so that the latter positively shuddered this is what i should have done i should have taken the money and jewels i should have walked out of there and have gone straight to some deserted place with fences round it and scarcely anyone to be seen some kitchen garden or place of that sort i should have looked out beforehand some stone weighing a hundredweight or more which had been lying in the corner from the time the house was built i would lift that stone there would sure to be a hollow under it and i would put the jewels and money in that hole then i d roll the stone back so that it would look as before would press it down with my foot and walk away and for a year or two three maybe i would not touch it and well they could search there d be no trace you are a madman said zametov and for some reason he too spoke in a whisper and moved away from raskolnikov whose eyes were glittering he had turned fearfully pale and his upper lip was twitching and quivering he bent down as close as possible to zametov and his lips began to move without uttering a word this lasted for half a minute he knew what he was doing but could not restrain himself the terrible word trembled on his lips like the latch on that door in another moment it will break out in another moment he will let it go he will speak out and what if it was i who murdered the old woman and lizaveta he said suddenly and realised what he had done zametov looked wildly at him and turned white as the tablecloth his face wore a contorted smile but is it possible he brought out faintly raskolnikov looked wrathfully at him own up that you believed it yes you did not a bit of it i believe it less than ever now zametov cried hastily i ve caught my cock sparrow so you did believe it before if now you believe less than ever not at all cried zametov obviously embarrassed have you been frightening me so as to lead up to this you don t believe it then what were you talking about behind my back when i went out of the police office and why did the explosive lieutenant question me after i fainted hey there he shouted to the waiter getting up and taking his cap how much thirty copecks the latter replied running up and there is twenty copecks for vodka see what a lot of money he held out his shaking hand to zametov with notes in it red notes and blue twenty five roubles where did i get them and where did my new clothes come from you know i had not a copeck you ve cross examined my landlady i ll be bound well that s enough assez cause till we meet again he went out trembling all over from a sort of wild hysterical sensation in which there was an element of insufferable rapture yet he was gloomy and terribly tired his face was twisted as after a fit his fatigue increased rapidly any shock any irritating sensation stimulated and revived his energies at once but his strength failed as quickly when the stimulus was removed zametov left alone sat for a long time in the same place plunged in thought raskolnikov had unwittingly worked a revolution in his brain on a certain point and had made up his mind for him conclusively ilya petrovitch is a blockhead he decided raskolnikov had hardly opened the door of the restaurant when he stumbled against razumihin on the steps they did not see each other till they almost knocked against each other for a moment they stood looking each other up and down razumihin was greatly astounded then anger real anger gleamed fiercely in his eyes so here you are he shouted at the top of his voice you ran away from your bed and here i ve been looking for you under the sofa we went up to the garret i almost beat nastasya on your account and here he is after all rodya what is the meaning of it tell me the whole truth confess do you hear it means that i m sick to death of you all and i want to be alone raskolnikov answered calmly alone when you are not able to walk when your face is as white as a sheet and you are gasping for breath idiot what have you been doing in the palais de cristal own up at once let me go said raskolnikov and tried to pass him this was too much for razumihin he gripped him firmly by the shoulder let you go you dare tell me to let you go do you know what i ll do with you directly i ll pick you up tie you up in a bundle carry you home under my arm and lock you up listen razumihin raskolnikov began quietly apparently calm can t you see that i don t want your benevolence a strange desire you have to shower benefits on a man who curses them who feels them a burden in fact why did you seek me out at the beginning of my illness maybe i was very glad to die didn t i tell you plainly enough to day that you were torturing me that i was sick of you you seem to want to torture people i assure you that all that is seriously hindering my recovery because it s continually irritating me you saw zossimov went away just now to avoid irritating me you leave me alone too for goodness sake what right have you indeed to keep me by force don t you see that i am in possession of all my faculties now how how can i persuade you not to persecute me with your kindness i may be ungrateful i may be mean only let me be for god s sake let me be let me be let me be he began calmly gloating beforehand over the venomous phrases he was about to utter but finished panting for breath in a frenzy as he had been with luzhin razumihin stood a moment thought and let his hand drop well go to hell then he said gently and thoughtfully stay he roared as raskolnikov was about to move listen to me let me tell you that you are all a set of babbling posing idiots if you ve any little trouble you brood over it like a hen over an egg and you are plagiarists even in that there isn t a sign of independent life in you you are made of spermaceti ointment and you ve lymph in your veins instead of blood i don t believe in anyone of you in any circumstances the first thing for all of you is to be unlike a human being stop he cried with redoubled fury noticing that raskolnikov was again making a movement hear me out you know i m having a house warming this evening i dare say they ve arrived by now but i left my uncle there i just ran in to receive the guests and if you weren t a fool a common fool a perfect fool if you were an original instead of a translation you see rodya i recognise you re a clever fellow but you re a fool and if you weren t a fool you d come round to me this evening instead of wearing out your boots in the street since you have gone out there s no help for it i d give you a snug easy chair my landlady has one a cup of tea company or you could lie on the sofa any way you would be with us zossimov will be there too will you come no r rubbish razumihin shouted out of patience how do you know you can t answer for yourself you don t know anything about it thousands of times i ve fought tooth and nail with people and run back to them afterwards one feels ashamed and goes back to a man so remember potchinkov s house on the third storey why mr razumihin i do believe you d let anybody beat you from sheer benevolence beat whom me i d twist his nose off at the mere idea potchinkov s house babushkin s flat i shall not come razumihin raskolnikov turned and walked away i bet you will razumihin shouted after him i refuse to know you if you don t stay hey is zametov in there yes did you see him yes talked to him yes what about confound you don t tell me then potchinkov s house babushkin s flat remember raskolnikov walked on and turned the corner into sadovy street razumihin looked after him thoughtfully then with a wave of his hand he went into the house but stopped short of the stairs confound it he went on almost aloud he talked sensibly but yet i am a fool as if madmen didn t talk sensibly and this was just what zossimov seemed afraid of he struck his finger on his forehead what if how could i let him go off alone he may drown himself ach what a blunder i can t and he ran back to overtake raskolnikov but there was no trace of him with a curse he returned with rapid steps to the palais de cristal to question zametov raskolnikov walked straight to x bridge stood in the middle and leaning both elbows on the rail stared into the distance on parting with razumihin he felt so much weaker that he could scarcely reach this place he longed to sit or lie down somewhere in the street bending over the water he gazed mechanically at the last pink flush of the sunset at the row of houses growing dark in the gathering twilight at one distant attic window on the left bank flashing as though on fire in the last rays of the setting sun at the darkening water of the canal and the water seemed to catch his attention at last red circles flashed before his eyes the houses seemed moving the passers by the canal banks the carriages all danced before his eyes suddenly he started saved again perhaps from swooning by an uncanny and hideous sight he became aware of someone standing on the right side of him he looked and saw a tall woman with a kerchief on her head with a long yellow wasted face and red sunken eyes she was looking straight at him but obviously she saw nothing and recognised no one suddenly she leaned her right hand on the parapet lifted her right leg over the railing then her left and threw herself into the canal the filthy water parted and swallowed up its victim for a moment but an instant later the drowning woman floated to the surface moving slowly with the current her head and legs in the water her skirt inflated like a balloon over her back a woman drowning a woman drowning shouted dozens of voices people ran up both banks were thronged with spectators on the bridge people crowded about raskolnikov pressing up behind him mercy on it it s our afrosinya a woman cried tearfully close by mercy save her kind people pull her out a boat a boat was shouted in the crowd but there was no need of a boat a policeman ran down the steps to the canal threw off his great coat and his boots and rushed into the water it was easy to reach her she floated within a couple of yards from the steps he caught hold of her clothes with his right hand and with his left seized a pole which a comrade held out to him the drowning woman was pulled out at once they laid her on the granite pavement of the embankment she soon recovered consciousness raised her head sat up and began sneezing and coughing stupidly wiping her wet dress with her hands she said nothing she s drunk herself out of her senses the same woman s voice wailed at her side out of her senses the other day she tried to hang herself we cut her down i ran out to the shop just now left my little girl to look after her and here she s in trouble again a neighbour gentleman a neighbour we live close by the second house from the end see yonder the crowd broke up the police still remained round the woman someone mentioned the police station raskolnikov looked on with a strange sensation of indifference and apathy he felt disgusted no that s loathsome water it s not good enough he muttered to himself nothing will come of it he added no use to wait what about the police office and why isn t zametov at the police office the police office is open till ten o clock he turned his back to the railing and looked about him very well then he said resolutely he moved from the bridge and walked in the direction of the police office his heart felt hollow and empty he did not want to think even his depression had passed there was not a trace now of the energy with which he had set out to make an end of it all complete apathy had succeeded to it well it s a way out of it he thought walking slowly and listlessly along the canal bank anyway i ll make an end for i want to but is it a way out what does it matter there ll be the square yard of space ha but what an end is it really the end shall i tell them or not ah damn how tired i am if i could find somewhere to sit or lie down soon what i am most ashamed of is its being so stupid but i don t care about that either what idiotic ideas come into one s head to reach the police office he had to go straight forward and take the second turning to the left it was only a few paces away but at the first turning he stopped and after a minute s thought turned into a side street and went two streets out of his way possibly without any object or possibly to delay a minute and gain time he walked looking at the ground suddenly someone seemed to whisper in his ear he lifted his head and saw that he was standing at the very gate of the house he had not passed it he had not been near it since that evening an overwhelming unaccountable prompting drew him on he went into the house passed through the gateway then into the first entrance on the right and began mounting the familiar staircase to the fourth storey the narrow steep staircase was very dark he stopped at each landing and looked round him with curiosity on the first landing the framework of the window had been taken out that wasn t so then he thought here was the flat on the second storey where nikolay and dmitri had been working it s shut up and the door newly painted so it s to let then the third storey and the fourth here he was perplexed to find the door of the flat wide open there were men there he could hear voices he had not expected that after brief hesitation he mounted the last stairs and went into the flat it too was being done up there were workmen in it this seemed to amaze him he somehow fancied that he would find everything as he left it even perhaps the corpses in the same places on the floor and now bare walls no furniture it seemed strange he walked to the window and sat down on the window sill there were two workmen both young fellows but one much younger than the other they were papering the walls with a new white paper covered with lilac flowers instead of the old dirty yellow one raskolnikov for some reason felt horribly annoyed by this he looked at the new paper with dislike as though he felt sorry to have it all so changed the workmen had obviously stayed beyond their time and now they were hurriedly rolling up their paper and getting ready to go home they took no notice of raskolnikov s coming in they were talking raskolnikov folded his arms and listened she comes to me in the morning said the elder to the younger very early all dressed up why are you preening and prinking says i i am ready to do anything to please you tit vassilitch that s a way of going on and she dressed up like a regular fashion book and what is a fashion book the younger one asked he obviously regarded the other as an authority a fashion book is a lot of pictures coloured and they come to the tailors here every saturday by post from abroad to show folks how to dress the male sex as well as the female they re pictures the gentlemen are generally wearing fur coats and for the ladies fluffles they re beyond anything you can fancy there s nothing you can t find in petersburg the younger cried enthusiastically except father and mother there s everything except them there s everything to be found my boy the elder declared sententiously raskolnikov got up and walked into the other room where the strong box the bed and the chest of drawers had been the room seemed to him very tiny without furniture in it the paper was the same the paper in the corner showed where the case of ikons had stood he looked at it and went to the window the elder workman looked at him askance what do you want he asked suddenly instead of answering raskolnikov went into the passage and pulled the bell the same bell the same cracked note he rang it a second and a third time he listened and remembered the hideous and agonisingly fearful sensation he had felt then began to come back more and more vividly he shuddered at every ring and it gave him more and more satisfaction well what do you want who are you the workman shouted going out to him raskolnikov went inside again i want to take a flat he said i am looking round it s not the time to look at rooms at night and you ought to come up with the porter the floors have been washed will they be painted raskolnikov went on is there no blood what blood why the old woman and her sister were murdered here there was a perfect pool there but who are you the workman cried uneasy who am i yes you want to know come to the police station i ll tell you the workmen looked at him in amazement it s time for us to go we are late come along alyoshka we must lock up said the elder workman very well come along said raskolnikov indifferently and going out first he went slowly downstairs hey porter he cried in the gateway at the entrance several people were standing staring at the passers by the two porters a peasant woman a man in a long coat and a few others raskolnikov went straight up to them what do you want asked one of the porters have you been to the police office i ve just been there what do you want is it open of course is the assistant there he was there for a time what do you want raskolnikov made no reply but stood beside them lost in thought he s been to look at the flat said the elder workman coming forward which flat where we are at work why have you washed away the blood says he there has been a murder here says he and i ve come to take it and he began ringing at the bell all but broke it come to the police station says he i ll tell you everything there he wouldn t leave us the porter looked at raskolnikov frowning and perplexed who are you he shouted as impressively as he could i am rodion romanovitch raskolnikov formerly a student i live in shil s house not far from here flat number ask the porter he knows me raskolnikov said all this in a lazy dreamy voice not turning round but looking intently into the darkening street why have you been to the flat to look at it what is there to look at take him straight to the police station the man in the long coat jerked in abruptly raskolnikov looked intently at him over his shoulder and said in the same slow lazy tones come along yes take him the man went on more confidently why was he going into that what s in his mind eh he s not drunk but god knows what s the matter with him muttered the workman but what do you want the porter shouted again beginning to get angry in earnest why are you hanging about you funk the police station then said raskolnikov jeeringly how funk it why are you hanging about he s a rogue shouted the peasant woman why waste time talking to him cried the other porter a huge peasant in a full open coat and with keys on his belt get along he is a rogue and no mistake get along and seizing raskolnikov by the shoulder he flung him into the street he lurched forward but recovered his footing looked at the spectators in silence and walked away strange man observed the workman there are strange folks about nowadays said the woman you should have taken him to the police station all the same said the man in the long coat better have nothing to do with him decided the big porter a regular rogue just what he wants you may be sure but once take him up you won t get rid of him we know the sort shall i go there or not thought raskolnikov standing in the middle of the thoroughfare at the cross roads and he looked about him as though expecting from someone a decisive word but no sound came all was dead and silent like the stones on which he walked dead to him to him alone all at once at the end of the street two hundred yards away in the gathering dusk he saw a crowd and heard talk and shouts in the middle of the crowd stood a carriage a light gleamed in the middle of the street what is it raskolnikov turned to the right and went up to the crowd he seemed to clutch at everything and smiled coldly when he recognised it for he had fully made up his mind to go to the police station and knew that it would all soon be over chapter vii an elegant carriage stood in the middle of the road with a pair of spirited grey horses there was no one in it and the coachman had got off his box and stood by the horses were being held by the bridle a mass of people had gathered round the police standing in front one of them held a lighted lantern which he was turning on something lying close to the wheels everyone was talking shouting exclaiming the coachman seemed at a loss and kept repeating what a misfortune good lord what a misfortune raskolnikov pushed his way in as far as he could and succeeded at last in seeing the object of the commotion and interest on the ground a man who had been run over lay apparently unconscious and covered with blood he was very badly dressed but not like a workman blood was flowing from his head and face his face was crushed mutilated and disfigured he was evidently badly injured merciful heaven wailed the coachman what more could i do if i d been driving fast or had not shouted to him but i was going quietly not in a hurry everyone could see i was going along just like everybody else a drunken man can t walk straight we all know i saw him crossing the street staggering and almost falling i shouted again and a second and a third time then i held the horses in but he fell straight under their feet either he did it on purpose or he was very tipsy the horses are young and ready to take fright they started he screamed that made them worse that s how it happened that s just how it was a voice in the crowd confirmed he shouted that s true he shouted three times another voice declared three times it was we all heard it shouted a third but the coachman was not very much distressed and frightened it was evident that the carriage belonged to a rich and important person who was awaiting it somewhere the police of course were in no little anxiety to avoid upsetting his arrangements all they had to do was to take the injured man to the police station and the hospital no one knew his name meanwhile raskolnikov had squeezed in and stooped closer over him the lantern suddenly lighted up the unfortunate man s face he recognised him i know him i know him he shouted pushing to the front it s a government clerk retired from the service marmeladov he lives close by in kozel s house make haste for a doctor i will pay see he pulled money out of his pocket and showed it to the policeman he was in violent agitation the police were glad that they had found out who the man was raskolnikov gave his own name and address and as earnestly as if it had been his father he besought the police to carry the unconscious marmeladov to his lodging at once just here three houses away he said eagerly the house belongs to kozel a rich german he was going home no doubt drunk i know him he is a drunkard he has a family there a wife children he has one daughter it will take time to take him to the hospital and there is sure to be a doctor in the house i ll pay i ll pay at least he will be looked after at home they will help him at once but he ll die before you get him to the hospital he managed to slip something unseen into the policeman s hand but the thing was straightforward and legitimate and in any case help was closer here they raised the injured man people volunteered to help kozel s house was thirty yards away raskolnikov walked behind carefully holding marmeladov s head and showing the way this way this way we must take him upstairs head foremost turn round i ll pay i ll make it worth your while he muttered katerina ivanovna had just begun as she always did at every free moment walking to and fro in her little room from window to stove and back again with her arms folded across her chest talking to herself and coughing of late she had begun to talk more than ever to her eldest girl polenka a child of ten who though there was much she did not understand understood very well that her mother needed her and so always watched her with her big clever eyes and strove her utmost to appear to understand this time polenka was undressing her little brother who had been unwell all day and was going to bed the boy was waiting for her to take off his shirt which had to be washed at night he was sitting straight and motionless on a chair with a silent serious face with his legs stretched out straight before him heels together and toes turned out he was listening to what his mother was saying to his sister sitting perfectly still with pouting lips and wide open eyes just as all good little boys have to sit when they are undressed to go to bed a little girl still younger dressed literally in rags stood at the screen waiting for her turn the door on to the stairs was open to relieve them a little from the clouds of tobacco smoke which floated in from the other rooms and brought on long terrible fits of coughing in the poor consumptive woman katerina ivanovna seemed to have grown even thinner during that week and the hectic flush on her face was brighter than ever you wouldn t believe you can t imagine polenka she said walking about the room what a happy luxurious life we had in my papa s house and how this drunkard has brought me and will bring you all to ruin papa was a civil colonel and only a step from being a governor so that everyone who came to see him said we look upon you ivan mihailovitch as our governor when i when she coughed violently oh cursed life she cried clearing her throat and pressing her hands to her breast when i when at the last ball at the marshal s princess bezzemelny saw me who gave me the blessing when your father and i were married polenka she asked at once isn t that the pretty girl who danced the shawl dance at the breaking up you must mend that tear you must take your needle and darn it as i showed you or to morrow cough cough cough he will make the hole bigger she articulated with effort prince schegolskoy a kammerjunker had just come from petersburg then he danced the mazurka with me and wanted to make me an offer next day but i thanked him in flattering expressions and told him that my heart had long been another s that other was your father polya papa was fearfully angry is the water ready give me the shirt and the stockings lida said she to the youngest one you must manage without your chemise to night and lay your stockings out with it i ll wash them together how is it that drunken vagabond doesn t come in he has worn his shirt till it looks like a dish clout he has torn it to rags i d do it all together so as not to have to work two nights running oh dear cough cough cough cough again what s this she cried noticing a crowd in the passage and the men who were pushing into her room carrying a burden what is it what are they bringing mercy on us where are we to put him asked the policeman looking round when marmeladov unconscious and covered with blood had been carried in on the sofa put him straight on the sofa with his head this way raskolnikov showed him run over in the road drunk someone shouted in the passage katerina ivanovna stood turning white and gasping for breath the children were terrified little lida screamed rushed to polenka and clutched at her trembling all over having laid marmeladov down raskolnikov flew to katerina ivanovna for god s sake be calm don t be frightened he said speaking quickly he was crossing the road and was run over by a carriage don t be frightened he will come to i told them bring him here i ve been here already you remember he will come to i ll pay he s done it this time katerina ivanovna cried despairingly and she rushed to her husband raskolnikov noticed at once that she was not one of those women who swoon easily she instantly placed under the luckless man s head a pillow which no one had thought of and began undressing and examining him she kept her head forgetting herself biting her trembling lips and stifling the screams which were ready to break from her raskolnikov meanwhile induced someone to run for a doctor there was a doctor it appeared next door but one i ve sent for a doctor he kept assuring katerina ivanovna don t be uneasy i ll pay haven t you water and give me a napkin or a towel anything as quick as you can he is injured but not killed believe me we shall see what the doctor says katerina ivanovna ran to the window there on a broken chair in the corner a large earthenware basin full of water had been stood in readiness for washing her children s and husband s linen that night this washing was done by katerina ivanovna at night at least twice a week if not oftener for the family had come to such a pass that they were practically without change of linen and katerina ivanovna could not endure uncleanliness and rather than see dirt in the house she preferred to wear herself out at night working beyond her strength when the rest were asleep so as to get the wet linen hung on a line and dry by the morning she took up the basin of water at raskolnikov s request but almost fell down with her burden but the latter had already succeeded in finding a towel wetted it and began washing the blood off marmeladov s face katerina ivanovna stood by breathing painfully and pressing her hands to her breast she was in need of attention herself raskolnikov began to realise that he might have made a mistake in having the injured man brought here the policeman too stood in hesitation polenka cried katerina ivanovna run to sonia make haste if you don t find her at home leave word that her father has been run over and that she is to come here at once when she comes in run polenka there put on the shawl run your fastest cried the little boy on the chair suddenly after which he relapsed into the same dumb rigidity with round eyes his heels thrust forward and his toes spread out meanwhile the room had become so full of people that you couldn t have dropped a pin the policemen left all except one who remained for a time trying to drive out the people who came in from the stairs almost all madame lippevechsel s lodgers had streamed in from the inner rooms of the flat at first they were squeezed together in the doorway but afterwards they overflowed into the room katerina ivanovna flew into a fury you might let him die in peace at least she shouted at the crowd is it a spectacle for you to gape at with cigarettes cough cough cough you might as well keep your hats on and there is one in his hat get away you should respect the dead at least her cough choked her but her reproaches were not without result they evidently stood in some awe of katerina ivanovna the lodgers one after another squeezed back into the doorway with that strange inner feeling of satisfaction which may be observed in the presence of a sudden accident even in those nearest and dearest to the victim from which no living man is exempt even in spite of the sincerest sympathy and compassion voices outside were heard however speaking of the hospital and saying that they d no business to make a disturbance here no business to die cried katerina ivanovna and she was rushing to the door to vent her wrath upon them but in the doorway came face to face with madame lippevechsel who had only just heard of the accident and ran in to restore order she was a particularly quarrelsome and irresponsible german ah my god she cried clasping her hands your husband drunken horses have trampled to the hospital with him i am the landlady amalia ludwigovna i beg you to recollect what you are saying katerina ivanovna began haughtily she always took a haughty tone with the landlady that she might remember her place and even now could not deny herself this satisfaction amalia ludwigovna i have you once before told that you to call me amalia ludwigovna may not dare i am amalia ivanovna you are not amalia ivanovna but amalia ludwigovna and as i am not one of your despicable flatterers like mr lebeziatnikov who s laughing behind the door at this moment a laugh and a cry of they are at it again was in fact audible at the door so i shall always call you amalia ludwigovna though i fail to understand why you dislike that name you can see for yourself what has happened to semyon zaharovitch he is dying i beg you to close that door at once and to admit no one let him at least die in peace or i warn you the governor general himself shall be informed of your conduct to morrow the prince knew me as a girl he remembers semyon zaharovitch well and has often been a benefactor to him everyone knows that semyon zaharovitch had many friends and protectors whom he abandoned himself from an honourable pride knowing his unhappy weakness but now she pointed to raskolnikov a generous young man has come to our assistance who has wealth and connections and whom semyon zaharovitch has known from a child you may rest assured amalia ludwigovna all this was uttered with extreme rapidity getting quicker and quicker but a cough suddenly cut short katerina ivanovna s eloquence at that instant the dying man recovered consciousness and uttered a groan she ran to him the injured man opened his eyes and without recognition or understanding gazed at raskolnikov who was bending over him he drew deep slow painful breaths blood oozed at the corners of his mouth and drops of perspiration came out on his forehead not recognising raskolnikov he began looking round uneasily katerina ivanovna looked at him with a sad but stern face and tears trickled from her eyes my god his whole chest is crushed how he is bleeding she said in despair we must take off his clothes turn a little semyon zaharovitch if you can she cried to him marmeladov recognised her a priest he articulated huskily katerina ivanovna walked to the window laid her head against the window frame and exclaimed in despair oh cursed life a priest the dying man said again after a moment s silence they ve gone for him katerina ivanovna shouted to him he obeyed her shout and was silent with sad and timid eyes he looked for her she returned and stood by his pillow he seemed a little easier but not for long soon his eyes rested on little lida his favourite who was shaking in the corner as though she were in a fit and staring at him with her wondering childish eyes a ah he signed towards her uneasily he wanted to say something what now cried katerina ivanovna barefoot barefoot he muttered indicating with frenzied eyes the child s bare feet be silent katerina ivanovna cried irritably you know why she is barefooted thank god the doctor exclaimed raskolnikov relieved the doctor came in a precise little old man a german looking about him mistrustfully he went up to the sick man took his pulse carefully felt his head and with the help of katerina ivanovna he unbuttoned the blood stained shirt and bared the injured man s chest it was gashed crushed and fractured several ribs on the right side were broken on the left side just over the heart was a large sinister looking yellowish black bruise a cruel kick from the horse s hoof the doctor frowned the policeman told him that he was caught in the wheel and turned round with it for thirty yards on the road it s wonderful that he has recovered consciousness the doctor whispered softly to raskolnikov what do you think of him he asked he will die immediately is there really no hope not the faintest he is at the last gasp his head is badly injured too hm i could bleed him if you like but it would be useless he is bound to die within the next five or ten minutes better bleed him then if you like but i warn you it will be perfectly useless at that moment other steps were heard the crowd in the passage parted and the priest a little grey old man appeared in the doorway bearing the sacrament a policeman had gone for him at the time of the accident the doctor changed places with him exchanging glances with him raskolnikov begged the doctor to remain a little while he shrugged his shoulders and remained all stepped back the confession was soon over the dying man probably understood little he could only utter indistinct broken sounds katerina ivanovna took little lida lifted the boy from the chair knelt down in the corner by the stove and made the children kneel in front of her the little girl was still trembling but the boy kneeling on his little bare knees lifted his hand rhythmically crossing himself with precision and bowed down touching the floor with his forehead which seemed to afford him especial satisfaction katerina ivanovna bit her lips and held back her tears she prayed too now and then pulling straight the boy s shirt and managed to cover the girl s bare shoulders with a kerchief which she took from the chest without rising from her knees or ceasing to pray meanwhile the door from the inner rooms was opened inquisitively again in the passage the crowd of spectators from all the flats on the staircase grew denser and denser but they did not venture beyond the threshold a single candle end lighted up the scene at that moment polenka forced her way through the crowd at the door she came in panting from running so fast took off her kerchief looked for her mother went up to her and said she s coming i met her in the street her mother made her kneel beside her timidly and noiselessly a young girl made her way through the crowd and strange was her appearance in that room in the midst of want rags death and despair she too was in rags her attire was all of the cheapest but decked out in gutter finery of a special stamp unmistakably betraying its shameful purpose sonia stopped short in the doorway and looked about her bewildered unconscious of everything she forgot her fourth hand gaudy silk dress so unseemly here with its ridiculous long train and her immense crinoline that filled up the whole doorway and her light coloured shoes and the parasol she brought with her though it was no use at night and the absurd round straw hat with its flaring flame coloured feather under this rakishly tilted hat was a pale frightened little face with lips parted and eyes staring in terror sonia was a small thin girl of eighteen with fair hair rather pretty with wonderful blue eyes she looked intently at the bed and the priest she too was out of breath with running at last whispers some words in the crowd probably reached her she looked down and took a step forward into the room still keeping close to the door the service was over katerina ivanovna went up to her husband again the priest stepped back and turned to say a few words of admonition and consolation to katerina ivanovna on leaving what am i to do with these she interrupted sharply and irritably pointing to the little ones god is merciful look to the most high for succour the priest began ach he is merciful but not to us that s a sin a sin madam observed the priest shaking his head and isn t that a sin cried katerina ivanovna pointing to the dying man perhaps those who have involuntarily caused the accident will agree to compensate you at least for the loss of his earnings you don t understand cried katerina ivanovna angrily waving her hand and why should they compensate me why he was drunk and threw himself under the horses what earnings he brought us in nothing but misery he drank everything away the drunkard he robbed us to get drink he wasted their lives and mine for drink and thank god he s dying one less to keep you must forgive in the hour of death that s a sin madam such feelings are a great sin katerina ivanovna was busy with the dying man she was giving him water wiping the blood and sweat from his head setting his pillow straight and had only turned now and then for a moment to address the priest now she flew at him almost in a frenzy ah father that s words and only words forgive if he d not been run over he d have come home to day drunk and his only shirt dirty and in rags and he d have fallen asleep like a log and i should have been sousing and rinsing till daybreak washing his rags and the children s and then drying them by the window and as soon as it was daylight i should have been darning them that s how i spend my nights what s the use of talking of forgiveness i have forgiven as it is a terrible hollow cough interrupted her words she put her handkerchief to her lips and showed it to the priest pressing her other hand to her aching chest the handkerchief was covered with blood the priest bowed his head and said nothing marmeladov was in the last agony he did not take his eyes off the face of katerina ivanovna who was bending over him again he kept trying to say something to her he began moving his tongue with difficulty and articulating indistinctly but katerina ivanovna understanding that he wanted to ask her forgiveness called peremptorily to him be silent no need i know what you want to say and the sick man was silent but at the same instant his wandering eyes strayed to the doorway and he saw sonia till then he had not noticed her she was standing in the shadow in a corner who s that who s that he said suddenly in a thick gasping voice in agitation turning his eyes in horror towards the door where his daughter was standing and trying to sit up lie down lie do own cried katerina ivanovna with unnatural strength he had succeeded in propping himself on his elbow he looked wildly and fixedly for some time on his daughter as though not recognising her he had never seen her before in such attire suddenly he recognised her crushed and ashamed in her humiliation and gaudy finery meekly awaiting her turn to say good bye to her dying father his face showed intense suffering sonia daughter forgive he cried and he tried to hold out his hand to her but losing his balance he fell off the sofa face downwards on the floor they rushed to pick him up they put him on the sofa but he was dying sonia with a faint cry ran up embraced him and remained so without moving he died in her arms he s got what he wanted katerina ivanovna cried seeing her husband s dead body well what s to be done now how am i to bury him what can i give them to morrow to eat raskolnikov went up to katerina ivanovna katerina ivanovna he began last week your husband told me all his life and circumstances believe me he spoke of you with passionate reverence from that evening when i learnt how devoted he was to you all and how he loved and respected you especially katerina ivanovna in spite of his unfortunate weakness from that evening we became friends allow me now to do something to repay my debt to my dead friend here are twenty roubles i think and if that can be of any assistance to you then i in short i will come again i will be sure to come again i shall perhaps come again to morrow good bye and he went quickly out of the room squeezing his way through the crowd to the stairs but in the crowd he suddenly jostled against nikodim fomitch who had heard of the accident and had come to give instructions in person they had not met since the scene at the police station but nikodim fomitch knew him instantly ah is that you he asked him he s dead answered raskolnikov the doctor and the priest have been all as it should have been don t worry the poor woman too much she is in consumption as it is try and cheer her up if possible you are a kind hearted man i know he added with a smile looking straight in his face but you are spattered with blood observed nikodim fomitch noticing in the lamplight some fresh stains on raskolnikov s waistcoat yes i m covered with blood raskolnikov said with a peculiar air then he smiled nodded and went downstairs he walked down slowly and deliberately feverish but not conscious of it entirely absorbed in a new overwhelming sensation of life and strength that surged up suddenly within him this sensation might be compared to that of a man condemned to death who has suddenly been pardoned halfway down the staircase he was overtaken by the priest on his way home raskolnikov let him pass exchanging a silent greeting with him he was just descending the last steps when he heard rapid footsteps behind him someone overtook him it was polenka she was running after him calling wait wait he turned round she was at the bottom of the staircase and stopped short a step above him a dim light came in from the yard raskolnikov could distinguish the child s thin but pretty little face looking at him with a bright childish smile she had run after him with a message which she was evidently glad to give tell me what is your name and where do you live she said hurriedly in a breathless voice he laid both hands on her shoulders and looked at her with a sort of rapture it was such a joy to him to look at her he could not have said why who sent you sister sonia sent me answered the girl smiling still more brightly i knew it was sister sonia sent you mamma sent me too when sister sonia was sending me mamma came up too and said run fast polenka do you love sister sonia i love her more than anyone polenka answered with a peculiar earnestness and her smile became graver and will you love me by way of answer he saw the little girl s face approaching him her full lips naively held out to kiss him suddenly her arms as thin as sticks held him tightly her head rested on his shoulder and the little girl wept softly pressing her face against him i am sorry for father she said a moment later raising her tear stained face and brushing away the tears with her hands it s nothing but misfortunes now she added suddenly with that peculiarly sedate air which children try hard to assume when they want to speak like grown up people did your father love you he loved lida most she went on very seriously without a smile exactly like grown up people he loved her because she is little and because she is ill too and he always used to bring her presents but he taught us to read and me grammar and scripture too she added with dignity and mother never used to say anything but we knew that she liked it and father knew it too and mother wants to teach me french for it s time my education began and do you know your prayers of course we do we knew them long ago i say my prayers to myself as i am a big girl now but kolya and lida say them aloud with mother first they repeat the ave maria and then another prayer lord forgive and bless sister sonia and then another lord forgive and bless our second father for our elder father is dead and this is another one but we do pray for the other as well polenka my name is rodion pray sometimes for me too and thy servant rodion nothing more i ll pray for you all the rest of my life the little girl declared hotly and suddenly smiling again she rushed at him and hugged him warmly once more raskolnikov told her his name and address and promised to be sure to come next day the child went away quite enchanted with him it was past ten when he came out into the street in five minutes he was standing on the bridge at the spot where the woman had jumped in enough he pronounced resolutely and triumphantly i ve done with fancies imaginary terrors and phantoms life is real haven t i lived just now my life has not yet died with that old woman the kingdom of heaven to her and now enough madam leave me in peace now for the reign of reason and light and of will and of strength and now we will see we will try our strength he added defiantly as though challenging some power of darkness and i was ready to consent to live in a square of space i am very weak at this moment but i believe my illness is all over i knew it would be over when i went out by the way potchinkov s house is only a few steps away i certainly must go to razumihin even if it were not close by let him win his bet let us give him some satisfaction too no matter strength strength is what one wants you can get nothing without it and strength must be won by strength that s what they don t know he added proudly and self confidently and he walked with flagging footsteps from the bridge pride and self confidence grew continually stronger in him he was becoming a different man every moment what was it had happened to work this revolution in him he did not know himself like a man catching at a straw he suddenly felt that he too could live that there was still life for him that his life had not died with the old woman perhaps he was in too great a hurry with his conclusions but he did not think of that but i did ask her to remember thy servant rodion in her prayers the idea struck him well that was in case of emergency he added and laughed himself at his boyish sally he was in the best of spirits he easily found razumihin the new lodger was already known at potchinkov s and the porter at once showed him the way half way upstairs he could hear the noise and animated conversation of a big gathering of people the door was wide open on the stairs he could hear exclamations and discussion razumihin s room was fairly large the company consisted of fifteen people raskolnikov stopped in the entry where two of the landlady s servants were busy behind a screen with two samovars bottles plates and dishes of pie and savouries brought up from the landlady s kitchen raskolnikov sent in for razumihin he ran out delighted at the first glance it was apparent that he had had a great deal to drink and though no amount of liquor made razumihin quite drunk this time he was perceptibly affected by it listen raskolnikov hastened to say i ve only just come to tell you you ve won your bet and that no one really knows what may not happen to him i can t come in i am so weak that i shall fall down directly and so good evening and good bye come and see me to morrow do you know what i ll see you home if you say you re weak yourself you must and your visitors who is the curly headed one who has just peeped out he goodness only knows some friend of uncle s i expect or perhaps he has come without being invited i ll leave uncle with them he is an invaluable person pity i can t introduce you to him now but confound them all now they won t notice me and i need a little fresh air for you ve come just in the nick of time another two minutes and i should have come to blows they are talking such a lot of wild stuff you simply can t imagine what men will say though why shouldn t you imagine don t we talk nonsense ourselves and let them that s the way to learn not to wait a minute i ll fetch zossimov zossimov pounced upon raskolnikov almost greedily he showed a special interest in him soon his face brightened you must go to bed at once he pronounced examining the patient as far as he could and take something for the night will you take it i got it ready some time ago a powder two if you like answered raskolnikov the powder was taken at once it s a good thing you are taking him home observed zossimov to razumihin we shall see how he is to morrow to day he s not at all amiss a considerable change since the afternoon live and learn do you know what zossimov whispered to me when we were coming out razumihin blurted out as soon as they were in the street i won t tell you everything brother because they are such fools zossimov told me to talk freely to you on the way and get you to talk freely to me and afterwards i am to tell him about it for he s got a notion in his head that you are mad or close on it only fancy in the first place you ve three times the brains he has in the second if you are not mad you needn t care a hang that he has got such a wild idea and thirdly that piece of beef whose specialty is surgery has gone mad on mental diseases and what s brought him to this conclusion about you was your conversation to day with zametov zametov told you all about it yes and he did well now i understand what it all means and so does zametov well the fact is rodya the point is i am a little drunk now but that s no matter the point is that this idea you understand was just being hatched in their brains you understand that is no one ventured to say it aloud because the idea is too absurd and especially since the arrest of that painter that bubble s burst and gone for ever but why are they such fools i gave zametov a bit of a thrashing at the time that s between ourselves brother please don t let out a hint that you know of it i ve noticed he is a ticklish subject it was at luise ivanovna s but to day to day it s all cleared up that ilya petrovitch is at the bottom of it he took advantage of your fainting at the police station but he is ashamed of it himself now i know that raskolnikov listened greedily razumihin was drunk enough to talk too freely i fainted then because it was so close and the smell of paint said raskolnikov no need to explain that and it wasn t the paint only the fever had been coming on for a month zossimov testifies to that but how crushed that boy is now you wouldn t believe i am not worth his little finger he says yours he means he has good feelings at times brother but the lesson the lesson you gave him to day in the palais de cristal that was too good for anything you frightened him at first you know he nearly went into convulsions you almost convinced him again of the truth of all that hideous nonsense and then you suddenly put out your tongue at him there now what do you make of it it was perfect he is crushed annihilated now it was masterly by jove it s what they deserve ah that i wasn t there he was hoping to see you awfully porfiry too wants to make your acquaintance ah he too but why did they put me down as mad oh not mad i must have said too much brother what struck him you see was that only that subject seemed to interest you now it s clear why it did interest you knowing all the circumstances and how that irritated you and worked in with your illness i am a little drunk brother only confound him he has some idea of his own i tell you he s mad on mental diseases but don t you mind him for half a minute both were silent listen razumihin began raskolnikov i want to tell you plainly i ve just been at a death bed a clerk who died i gave them all my money and besides i ve just been kissed by someone who if i had killed anyone would just the same in fact i saw someone else there with a flame coloured feather but i am talking nonsense i am very weak support me we shall be at the stairs directly what s the matter what s the matter with you razumihin asked anxiously i am a little giddy but that s not the point i am so sad so sad like a woman look what s that look look what is it don t you see a light in my room you see through the crack they were already at the foot of the last flight of stairs at the level of the landlady s door and they could as a fact see from below that there was a light in raskolnikov s garret queer nastasya perhaps observed razumihin she is never in my room at this time and she must be in bed long ago but i don t care good bye what do you mean i am coming with you we ll come in together i know we are going in together but i want to shake hands here and say good bye to you here so give me your hand good bye what s the matter with you rodya nothing come along you shall be witness they began mounting the stairs and the idea struck razumihin that perhaps zossimov might be right after all ah i ve upset him with my chatter he muttered to himself when they reached the door they heard voices in the room what is it cried razumihin raskolnikov was the first to open the door he flung it wide and stood still in the doorway dumbfoundered his mother and sister were sitting on his sofa and had been waiting an hour and a half for him why had he never expected never thought of them though the news that they had started were on their way and would arrive immediately had been repeated to him only that day they had spent that hour and a half plying nastasya with questions she was standing before them and had told them everything by now they were beside themselves with alarm when they heard of his running away to day ill and as they understood from her story delirious good heavens what had become of him both had been weeping both had been in anguish for that hour and a half a cry of joy of ecstasy greeted raskolnikov s entrance both rushed to him but he stood like one dead a sudden intolerable sensation struck him like a thunderbolt he did not lift his arms to embrace them he could not his mother and sister clasped him in their arms kissed him laughed and cried he took a step tottered and fell to the ground fainting anxiety cries of horror moans razumihin who was standing in the doorway flew into the room seized the sick man in his strong arms and in a moment had him on the sofa it s nothing nothing he cried to the mother and sister it s only a faint a mere trifle only just now the doctor said he was much better that he is perfectly well water see he is coming to himself he is all right again and seizing dounia by the arm so that he almost dislocated it he made her bend down to see that he is all right again the mother and sister looked on him with emotion and gratitude as their providence they had heard already from nastasya all that had been done for their rodya during his illness by this very competent young man as pulcheria alexandrovna raskolnikov called him that evening in conversation with dounia part iii chapter i raskolnikov got up and sat down on the sofa he waved his hand weakly to razumihin to cut short the flow of warm and incoherent consolations he was addressing to his mother and sister took them both by the hand and for a minute or two gazed from one to the other without speaking his mother was alarmed by his expression it revealed an emotion agonisingly poignant and at the same time something immovable almost insane pulcheria alexandrovna began to cry avdotya romanovna was pale her hand trembled in her brother s go home with him he said in a broken voice pointing to razumihin good bye till to morrow to morrow everything is it long since you arrived this evening rodya answered pulcheria alexandrovna the train was awfully late but rodya nothing would induce me to leave you now i will spend the night here near you don t torture me he said with a gesture of irritation i will stay with him cried razumihin i won t leave him for a moment bother all my visitors let them rage to their hearts content my uncle is presiding there how how can i thank you pulcheria alexandrovna was beginning once more pressing razumihin s hands but raskolnikov interrupted her again i can t have it i can t have it he repeated irritably don t worry me enough go away i can t stand it come mamma come out of the room at least for a minute dounia whispered in dismay we are distressing him that s evident mayn t i look at him after three years wept pulcheria alexandrovna stay he stopped them again you keep interrupting me and my ideas get muddled have you seen luzhin no rodya but he knows already of our arrival we have heard rodya that pyotr petrovitch was so kind as to visit you today pulcheria alexandrovna added somewhat timidly yes he was so kind dounia i promised luzhin i d throw him downstairs and told him to go to hell rodya what are you saying surely you don t mean to tell us pulcheria alexandrovna began in alarm but she stopped looking at dounia avdotya romanovna was looking attentively at her brother waiting for what would come next both of them had heard of the quarrel from nastasya so far as she had succeeded in understanding and reporting it and were in painful perplexity and suspense dounia raskolnikov continued with an effort i don t want that marriage so at the first opportunity to morrow you must refuse luzhin so that we may never hear his name again good heavens cried pulcheria alexandrovna brother think what you are saying avdotya romanovna began impetuously but immediately checked herself you are not fit to talk now perhaps you are tired she added gently you think i am delirious no you are marrying luzhin for my sake but i won t accept the sacrifice and so write a letter before to morrow to refuse him let me read it in the morning and that will be the end of it that i can t do the girl cried offended what right have you dounia you are hasty too be quiet to morrow don t you see the mother interposed in dismay better come away he is raving razumihin cried tipsily or how would he dare to morrow all this nonsense will be over to day he certainly did drive him away that was so and luzhin got angry too he made speeches here wanted to show off his learning and he went out crest fallen then it s true cried pulcheria alexandrovna good bye till to morrow brother said dounia compassionately let us go mother good bye rodya do you hear sister he repeated after them making a last effort i am not delirious this marriage is an infamy let me act like a scoundrel but you mustn t one is enough and though i am a scoundrel i wouldn t own such a sister it s me or luzhin go now but you re out of your mind despot roared razumihin but raskolnikov did not and perhaps could not answer he lay down on the sofa and turned to the wall utterly exhausted avdotya romanovna looked with interest at razumihin her black eyes flashed razumihin positively started at her glance pulcheria alexandrovna stood overwhelmed nothing would induce me to go she whispered in despair to razumihin i will stay somewhere here escort dounia home you ll spoil everything razumihin answered in the same whisper losing patience come out on to the stairs anyway nastasya show a light i assure you he went on in a half whisper on the stairs that he was almost beating the doctor and me this afternoon do you understand the doctor himself even he gave way and left him so as not to irritate him i remained downstairs on guard but he dressed at once and slipped off and he will slip off again if you irritate him at this time of night and will do himself some mischief what are you saying and avdotya romanovna can t possibly be left in those lodgings without you just think where you are staying that blackguard pyotr petrovitch couldn t find you better lodgings but you know i ve had a little to drink and that s what makes me swear don t mind it but i ll go to the landlady here pulcheria alexandrovna insisted ill beseech her to find some corner for dounia and me for the night i can t leave him like that i cannot this conversation took place on the landing just before the landlady s door nastasya lighted them from a step below razumihin was in extraordinary excitement half an hour earlier while he was bringing raskolnikov home he had indeed talked too freely but he was aware of it himself and his head was clear in spite of the vast quantities he had imbibed now he was in a state bordering on ecstasy and all that he had drunk seemed to fly to his head with redoubled effect he stood with the two ladies seizing both by their hands persuading them and giving them reasons with astonishing plainness of speech and at almost every word he uttered probably to emphasise his arguments he squeezed their hands painfully as in a vise he stared at avdotya romanovna without the least regard for good manners they sometimes pulled their hands out of his huge bony paws but far from noticing what was the matter he drew them all the closer to him if they d told him to jump head foremost from the staircase he would have done it without thought or hesitation in their service though pulcheria alexandrovna felt that the young man was really too eccentric and pinched her hand too much in her anxiety over her rodya she looked on his presence as providential and was unwilling to notice all his peculiarities but though avdotya romanovna shared her anxiety and was not of timorous disposition she could not see the glowing light in his eyes without wonder and almost alarm it was only the unbounded confidence inspired by nastasya s account of her brother s queer friend which prevented her from trying to run away from him and to persuade her mother to do the same she realised too that even running away was perhaps impossible now ten minutes later however she was considerably reassured it was characteristic of razumihin that he showed his true nature at once whatever mood he might be in so that people quickly saw the sort of man they had to deal with you can t go to the landlady that s perfect nonsense he cried if you stay though you are his mother you ll drive him to a frenzy and then goodness knows what will happen listen i ll tell you what i ll do nastasya will stay with him now and i ll conduct you both home you can t be in the streets alone petersburg is an awful place in that way but no matter then i ll run straight back here and a quarter of an hour later on my word of honour i ll bring you news how he is whether he is asleep and all that then listen then i ll run home in a twinkling i ve a lot of friends there all drunk i ll fetch zossimov that s the doctor who is looking after him he is there too but he is not drunk he is not drunk he is never drunk i ll drag him to rodya and then to you so that you ll get two reports in the hour from the doctor you understand from the doctor himself that s a very different thing from my account of him if there s anything wrong i swear i ll bring you here myself but if it s all right you go to bed and i ll spend the night here in the passage he won t hear me and i ll tell zossimov to sleep at the landlady s to be at hand which is better for him you or the doctor so come home then but the landlady is out of the question it s all right for me but it s out of the question for you she wouldn t take you for she s for she s a fool she d be jealous on my account of avdotya romanovna and of you too if you want to know of avdotya romanovna certainly she is an absolutely absolutely unaccountable character but i am a fool too no matter come along do you trust me come do you trust me or not let us go mother said avdotya romanovna he will certainly do what he has promised he has saved rodya already and if the doctor really will consent to spend the night here what could be better you see you you understand me because you are an angel razumihin cried in ecstasy let us go nastasya fly upstairs and sit with him with a light i ll come in a quarter of an hour though pulcheria alexandrovna was not perfectly convinced she made no further resistance razumihin gave an arm to each and drew them down the stairs he still made her uneasy as though he was competent and good natured was he capable of carrying out his promise he seemed in such a condition ah i see you think i am in such a condition razumihin broke in upon her thoughts guessing them as he strolled along the pavement with huge steps so that the two ladies could hardly keep up with him a fact he did not observe however nonsense that is i am drunk like a fool but that s not it i am not drunk from wine it s seeing you has turned my head but don t mind me don t take any notice i am talking nonsense i am not worthy of you i am utterly unworthy of you the minute i ve taken you home i ll pour a couple of pailfuls of water over my head in the gutter here and then i shall be all right if only you knew how i love you both don t laugh and don t be angry you may be angry with anyone but not with me i am his friend and therefore i am your friend too i want to be i had a presentiment last year there was a moment though it wasn t a presentiment really for you seem to have fallen from heaven and i expect i shan t sleep all night zossimov was afraid a little time ago that he would go mad that s why he mustn t be irritated what do you say cried the mother did the doctor really say that asked avdotya romanovna alarmed yes but it s not so not a bit of it he gave him some medicine a powder i saw it and then your coming here ah it would have been better if you had come to morrow it s a good thing we went away and in an hour zossimov himself will report to you about everything he is not drunk and i shan t be drunk and what made me get so tight because they got me into an argument damn them i ve sworn never to argue they talk such trash i almost came to blows i ve left my uncle to preside would you believe they insist on complete absence of individualism and that s just what they relish not to be themselves to be as unlike themselves as they can that s what they regard as the highest point of progress if only their nonsense were their own but as it is listen pulcheria alexandrovna interrupted timidly but it only added fuel to the flames what do you think shouted razumihin louder than ever you think i am attacking them for talking nonsense not a bit i like them to talk nonsense that s man s one privilege over all creation through error you come to the truth i am a man because i err you never reach any truth without making fourteen mistakes and very likely a hundred and fourteen and a fine thing too in its way but we can t even make mistakes on our own account talk nonsense but talk your own nonsense and i ll kiss you for it to go wrong in one s own way is better than to go right in someone else s in the first case you are a man in the second you re no better than a bird truth won t escape you but life can be cramped there have been examples and what are we doing now in science development thought invention ideals aims liberalism judgment experience and everything everything everything we are still in the preparatory class at school we prefer to live on other people s ideas it s what we are used to am i right am i right cried razumihin pressing and shaking the two ladies hands oh mercy i do not know cried poor pulcheria alexandrovna yes yes though i don t agree with you in everything added avdotya romanovna earnestly and at once uttered a cry for he squeezed her hand so painfully yes you say yes well after that you you he cried in a transport you are a fount of goodness purity sense and perfection give me your hand you give me yours too i want to kiss your hands here at once on my knees and he fell on his knees on the pavement fortunately at that time deserted leave off i entreat you what are you doing pulcheria alexandrovna cried greatly distressed get up get up said dounia laughing though she too was upset not for anything till you let me kiss your hands that s it enough i get up and we ll go on i am a luckless fool i am unworthy of you and drunk and i am ashamed i am not worthy to love you but to do homage to you is the duty of every man who is not a perfect beast and i ve done homage here are your lodgings and for that alone rodya was right in driving your pyotr petrovitch away how dare he how dare he put you in such lodgings it s a scandal do you know the sort of people they take in here and you his betrothed you are his betrothed yes well then i ll tell you your fiance is a scoundrel excuse me mr razumihin you are forgetting pulcheria alexandrovna was beginning yes yes you are right i did forget myself i am ashamed of it razumihin made haste to apologise but but you can t be angry with me for speaking so for i speak sincerely and not because hm hm that would be disgraceful in fact not because i m in hm well anyway i won t say why i daren t but we all saw to day when he came in that that man is not of our sort not because he had his hair curled at the barber s not because he was in such a hurry to show his wit but because he is a spy a speculator because he is a skin flint and a buffoon that s evident do you think him clever no he is a fool a fool and is he a match for you good heavens do you see ladies he stopped suddenly on the way upstairs to their rooms though all my friends there are drunk yet they are all honest and though we do talk a lot of trash and i do too yet we shall talk our way to the truth at last for we are on the right path while pyotr petrovitch is not on the right path though i ve been calling them all sorts of names just now i do respect them all though i don t respect zametov i like him for he is a puppy and that bullock zossimov because he is an honest man and knows his work but enough it s all said and forgiven is it forgiven well then let s go on i know this corridor i ve been here there was a scandal here at number where are you here which number eight well lock yourselves in for the night then don t let anybody in in a quarter of an hour i ll come back with news and half an hour later i ll bring zossimov you ll see good bye i ll run good heavens dounia what is going to happen said pulcheria alexandrovna addressing her daughter with anxiety and dismay don t worry yourself mother said dounia taking off her hat and cape god has sent this gentleman to our aid though he has come from a drinking party we can depend on him i assure you and all that he has done for rodya ah dounia goodness knows whether he will come how could i bring myself to leave rodya and how different how different i had fancied our meeting how sullen he was as though not pleased to see us tears came into her eyes no it s not that mother you didn t see you were crying all the time he is quite unhinged by serious illness that s the reason ah that illness what will happen what will happen and how he talked to you dounia said the mother looking timidly at her daughter trying to read her thoughts and already half consoled by dounia s standing up for her brother which meant that she had already forgiven him i am sure he will think better of it to morrow she added probing her further and i am sure that he will say the same to morrow about that avdotya romanovna said finally and of course there was no going beyond that for this was a point which pulcheria alexandrovna was afraid to discuss dounia went up and kissed her mother the latter warmly embraced her without speaking then she sat down to wait anxiously for razumihin s return timidly watching her daughter who walked up and down the room with her arms folded lost in thought this walking up and down when she was thinking was a habit of avdotya romanovna s and the mother was always afraid to break in on her daughter s mood at such moments razumihin of course was ridiculous in his sudden drunken infatuation for avdotya romanovna yet apart from his eccentric condition many people would have thought it justified if they had seen avdotya romanovna especially at that moment when she was walking to and fro with folded arms pensive and melancholy avdotya romanovna was remarkably good looking she was tall strikingly well proportioned strong and self reliant the latter quality was apparent in every gesture though it did not in the least detract from the grace and softness of her movements in face she resembled her brother but she might be described as really beautiful her hair was dark brown a little lighter than her brother s there was a proud light in her almost black eyes and yet at times a look of extraordinary kindness she was pale but it was a healthy pallor her face was radiant with freshness and vigour her mouth was rather small the full red lower lip projected a little as did her chin it was the only irregularity in her beautiful face but it gave it a peculiarly individual and almost haughty expression her face was always more serious and thoughtful than gay but how well smiles how well youthful lighthearted irresponsible laughter suited her face it was natural enough that a warm open simple hearted honest giant like razumihin who had never seen anyone like her and was not quite sober at the time should lose his head immediately besides as chance would have it he saw dounia for the first time transfigured by her love for her brother and her joy at meeting him afterwards he saw her lower lip quiver with indignation at her brother s insolent cruel and ungrateful words and his fate was sealed he had spoken the truth moreover when he blurted out in his drunken talk on the stairs that praskovya pavlovna raskolnikov s eccentric landlady would be jealous of pulcheria alexandrovna as well as of avdotya romanovna on his account although pulcheria alexandrovna was forty three her face still retained traces of her former beauty she looked much younger than her age indeed which is almost always the case with women who retain serenity of spirit sensitiveness and pure sincere warmth of heart to old age we may add in parenthesis that to preserve all this is the only means of retaining beauty to old age her hair had begun to grow grey and thin there had long been little crow s foot wrinkles round her eyes her cheeks were hollow and sunken from anxiety and grief and yet it was a handsome face she was dounia over again twenty years older but without the projecting underlip pulcheria alexandrovna was emotional but not sentimental timid and yielding but only to a certain point she could give way and accept a great deal even of what was contrary to her convictions but there was a certain barrier fixed by honesty principle and the deepest convictions which nothing would induce her to cross exactly twenty minutes after razumihin s departure there came two subdued but hurried knocks at the door he had come back i won t come in i haven t time he hastened to say when the door was opened he sleeps like a top soundly quietly and god grant he may sleep ten hours nastasya s with him i told her not to leave till i came now i am fetching zossimov he will report to you and then you d better turn in i can see you are too tired to do anything and he ran off down the corridor what a very competent and devoted young man cried pulcheria alexandrovna exceedingly delighted he seems a splendid person avdotya romanovna replied with some warmth resuming her walk up and down the room it was nearly an hour later when they heard footsteps in the corridor and another knock at the door both women waited this time completely relying on razumihin s promise he actually had succeeded in bringing zossimov zossimov had agreed at once to desert the drinking party to go to raskolnikov s but he came reluctantly and with the greatest suspicion to see the ladies mistrusting razumihin in his exhilarated condition but his vanity was at once reassured and flattered he saw that they were really expecting him as an oracle he stayed just ten minutes and succeeded in completely convincing and comforting pulcheria alexandrovna he spoke with marked sympathy but with the reserve and extreme seriousness of a young doctor at an important consultation he did not utter a word on any other subject and did not display the slightest desire to enter into more personal relations with the two ladies remarking at his first entrance the dazzling beauty of avdotya romanovna he endeavoured not to notice her at all during his visit and addressed himself solely to pulcheria alexandrovna all this gave him extraordinary inward satisfaction he declared that he thought the invalid at this moment going on very satisfactorily according to his observations the patient s illness was due partly to his unfortunate material surroundings during the last few months but it had partly also a moral origin was so to speak the product of several material and moral influences anxieties apprehensions troubles certain ideas and so on noticing stealthily that avdotya romanovna was following his words with close attention zossimov allowed himself to enlarge on this theme on pulcheria alexandrovna s anxiously and timidly inquiring as to some suspicion of insanity he replied with a composed and candid smile that his words had been exaggerated that certainly the patient had some fixed idea something approaching a monomania he zossimov was now particularly studying this interesting branch of medicine but that it must be recollected that until to day the patient had been in delirium and and that no doubt the presence of his family would have a favourable effect on his recovery and distract his mind if only all fresh shocks can be avoided he added significantly then he got up took leave with an impressive and affable bow while blessings warm gratitude and entreaties were showered upon him and avdotya romanovna spontaneously offered her hand to him he went out exceedingly pleased with his visit and still more so with himself we ll talk to morrow go to bed at once razumihin said in conclusion following zossimov out i ll be with you to morrow morning as early as possible with my report that s a fetching little girl avdotya romanovna remarked zossimov almost licking his lips as they both came out into the street fetching you said fetching roared razumihin and he flew at zossimov and seized him by the throat if you ever dare do you understand do you understand he shouted shaking him by the collar and squeezing him against the wall do you hear let me go you drunken devil said zossimov struggling and when he had let him go he stared at him and went off into a sudden guffaw razumihin stood facing him in gloomy and earnest reflection of course i am an ass he observed sombre as a storm cloud but still you are another no brother not at all such another i am not dreaming of any folly they walked along in silence and only when they were close to raskolnikov s lodgings razumihin broke the silence in considerable anxiety listen he said you re a first rate fellow but among your other failings you re a loose fish that i know and a dirty one too you are a feeble nervous wretch and a mass of whims you re getting fat and lazy and can t deny yourself anything and i call that dirty because it leads one straight into the dirt you ve let yourself get so slack that i don t know how it is you are still a good even a devoted doctor you a doctor sleep on a feather bed and get up at night to your patients in another three or four years you won t get up for your patients but hang it all that s not the point you are going to spend to night in the landlady s flat here hard work i ve had to persuade her and i ll be in the kitchen so here s a chance for you to get to know her better it s not as you think there s not a trace of anything of the sort brother but i don t think here you have modesty brother silence bashfulness a savage virtue and yet she s sighing and melting like wax simply melting save me from her by all that s unholy she s most prepossessing i ll repay you i ll do anything zossimov laughed more violently than ever well you are smitten but what am i to do with her it won t be much trouble i assure you talk any rot you like to her as long as you sit by her and talk you re a doctor too try curing her of something i swear you won t regret it she has a piano and you know i strum a little i have a song there a genuine russian one i shed hot tears she likes the genuine article and well it all began with that song now you re a regular performer a maitre a rubinstein i assure you you won t regret it but have you made her some promise something signed a promise of marriage perhaps nothing nothing absolutely nothing of the kind besides she is not that sort at all tchebarov tried that well then drop her but i can t drop her like that why can t you well i can t that s all about it there s an element of attraction here brother then why have you fascinated her i haven t fascinated her perhaps i was fascinated myself in my folly but she won t care a straw whether it s you or i so long as somebody sits beside her sighing i can t explain the position brother look here you are good at mathematics and working at it now begin teaching her the integral calculus upon my soul i m not joking i m in earnest it ll be just the same to her she will gaze at you and sigh for a whole year together i talked to her once for two days at a time about the prussian house of lords for one must talk of something she just sighed and perspired and you mustn t talk of love she s bashful to hysterics but just let her see you can t tear yourself away that s enough it s fearfully comfortable you re quite at home you can read sit lie about write you may even venture on a kiss if you re careful but what do i want with her ach i can t make you understand you see you are made for each other i have often been reminded of you you ll come to it in the end so does it matter whether it s sooner or later there s the feather bed element here brother ach and not only that there s an attraction here here you have the end of the world an anchorage a quiet haven the navel of the earth the three fishes that are the foundation of the world the essence of pancakes of savoury fish pies of the evening samovar of soft sighs and warm shawls and hot stoves to sleep on as snug as though you were dead and yet you re alive the advantages of both at once well hang it brother what stuff i m talking it s bedtime listen i sometimes wake up at night so i ll go in and look at him but there s no need it s all right don t you worry yourself yet if you like you might just look in once too but if you notice anything delirium or fever wake me at once but there can t be chapter ii razumihin waked up next morning at eight o clock troubled and serious he found himself confronted with many new and unlooked for perplexities he had never expected that he would ever wake up feeling like that he remembered every detail of the previous day and he knew that a perfectly novel experience had befallen him that he had received an impression unlike anything he had known before at the same time he recognised clearly that the dream which had fired his imagination was hopelessly unattainable so unattainable that he felt positively ashamed of it and he hastened to pass to the other more practical cares and difficulties bequeathed him by that thrice accursed yesterday the most awful recollection of the previous day was the way he had shown himself base and mean not only because he had been drunk but because he had taken advantage of the young girl s position to abuse her fiance in his stupid jealousy knowing nothing of their mutual relations and obligations and next to nothing of the man himself and what right had he to criticise him in that hasty and unguarded manner who had asked for his opinion was it thinkable that such a creature as avdotya romanovna would be marrying an unworthy man for money so there must be something in him the lodgings but after all how could he know the character of the lodgings he was furnishing a flat foo how despicable it all was and what justification was it that he was drunk such a stupid excuse was even more degrading in wine is truth and the truth had all come out that is all the uncleanness of his coarse and envious heart and would such a dream ever be permissible to him razumihin what was he beside such a girl he the drunken noisy braggart of last night was it possible to imagine so absurd and cynical a juxtaposition razumihin blushed desperately at the very idea and suddenly the recollection forced itself vividly upon him of how he had said last night on the stairs that the landlady would be jealous of avdotya romanovna that was simply intolerable he brought his fist down heavily on the kitchen stove hurt his hand and sent one of the bricks flying of course he muttered to himself a minute later with a feeling of self abasement of course all these infamies can never be wiped out or smoothed over and so it s useless even to think of it and i must go to them in silence and do my duty in silence too and not ask forgiveness and say nothing for all is lost now and yet as he dressed he examined his attire more carefully than usual he hadn t another suit if he had had perhaps he wouldn t have put it on i would have made a point of not putting it on but in any case he could not remain a cynic and a dirty sloven he had no right to offend the feelings of others especially when they were in need of his assistance and asking him to see them he brushed his clothes carefully his linen was always decent in that respect he was especially clean he washed that morning scrupulously he got some soap from nastasya he washed his hair his neck and especially his hands when it came to the question whether to shave his stubbly chin or not praskovya pavlovna had capital razors that had been left by her late husband the question was angrily answered in the negative let it stay as it is what if they think that i shaved on purpose to they certainly would think so not on any account and the worst of it was he was so coarse so dirty he had the manners of a pothouse and and even admitting that he knew he had some of the essentials of a gentleman what was there in that to be proud of everyone ought to be a gentleman and more than that and all the same he remembered he too had done little things not exactly dishonest and yet and what thoughts he sometimes had hm and to set all that beside avdotya romanovna confound it so be it well he d make a point then of being dirty greasy pothouse in his manners and he wouldn t care he d be worse he was engaged in such monologues when zossimov who had spent the night in praskovya pavlovna s parlour came in he was going home and was in a hurry to look at the invalid first razumihin informed him that raskolnikov was sleeping like a dormouse zossimov gave orders that they shouldn t wake him and promised to see him again about eleven if he is still at home he added damn it all if one can t control one s patients how is one to cure them do you know whether he will go to them or whether they are coming here they are coming i think said razumihin understanding the object of the question and they will discuss their family affairs no doubt i ll be off you as the doctor have more right to be here than i but i am not a father confessor i shall come and go away i ve plenty to do besides looking after them one thing worries me interposed razumihin frowning on the way home i talked a lot of drunken nonsense to him all sorts of things and amongst them that you were afraid that he might become insane you told the ladies so too i know it was stupid you may beat me if you like did you think so seriously that s nonsense i tell you how could i think it seriously you yourself described him as a monomaniac when you fetched me to him and we added fuel to the fire yesterday you did that is with your story about the painter it was a nice conversation when he was perhaps mad on that very point if only i d known what happened then at the police station and that some wretch had insulted him with this suspicion hm i would not have allowed that conversation yesterday these monomaniacs will make a mountain out of a mole hill and see their fancies as solid realities as far as i remember it was zametov s story that cleared up half the mystery to my mind why i know one case in which a hypochondriac a man of forty cut the throat of a little boy of eight because he couldn t endure the jokes he made every day at table and in this case his rags the insolent police officer the fever and this suspicion all that working upon a man half frantic with hypochondria and with his morbid exceptional vanity that may well have been the starting point of illness well bother it all and by the way that zametov certainly is a nice fellow but hm he shouldn t have told all that last night he is an awful chatterbox but whom did he tell it to you and me and porfiry what does that matter and by the way have you any influence on them his mother and sister tell them to be more careful with him to day they ll get on all right razumihin answered reluctantly why is he so set against this luzhin a man with money and she doesn t seem to dislike him and they haven t a farthing i suppose eh but what business is it of yours razumihin cried with annoyance how can i tell whether they ve a farthing ask them yourself and perhaps you ll find out foo what an ass you are sometimes last night s wine has not gone off yet good bye thank your praskovya pavlovna from me for my night s lodging she locked herself in made no reply to my bonjour through the door she was up at seven o clock the samovar was taken into her from the kitchen i was not vouchsafed a personal interview at nine o clock precisely razumihin reached the lodgings at bakaleyev s house both ladies were waiting for him with nervous impatience they had risen at seven o clock or earlier he entered looking as black as night bowed awkwardly and was at once furious with himself for it he had reckoned without his host pulcheria alexandrovna fairly rushed at him seized him by both hands and was almost kissing them he glanced timidly at avdotya romanovna but her proud countenance wore at that moment an expression of such gratitude and friendliness such complete and unlooked for respect in place of the sneering looks and ill disguised contempt he had expected that it threw him into greater confusion than if he had been met with abuse fortunately there was a subject for conversation and he made haste to snatch at it hearing that everything was going well and that rodya had not yet waked pulcheria alexandrovna declared that she was glad to hear it because she had something which it was very very necessary to talk over beforehand then followed an inquiry about breakfast and an invitation to have it with them they had waited to have it with him avdotya romanovna rang the bell it was answered by a ragged dirty waiter and they asked him to bring tea which was served at last but in such a dirty and disorderly way that the ladies were ashamed razumihin vigorously attacked the lodgings but remembering luzhin stopped in embarrassment and was greatly relieved by pulcheria alexandrovna s questions which showered in a continual stream upon him he talked for three quarters of an hour being constantly interrupted by their questions and succeeded in describing to them all the most important facts he knew of the last year of raskolnikov s life concluding with a circumstantial account of his illness he omitted however many things which were better omitted including the scene at the police station with all its consequences they listened eagerly to his story and when he thought he had finished and satisfied his listeners he found that they considered he had hardly begun tell me tell me what do you think excuse me i still don t know your name pulcheria alexandrovna put in hastily dmitri prokofitch i should like very very much to know dmitri prokofitch how he looks on things in general now that is how can i explain what are his likes and dislikes is he always so irritable tell me if you can what are his hopes and so to say his dreams under what influences is he now in a word i should like ah mother how can he answer all that at once observed dounia good heavens i had not expected to find him in the least like this dmitri prokofitch naturally answered razumihin i have no mother but my uncle comes every year and almost every time he can scarcely recognise me even in appearance though he is a clever man and your three years separation means a great deal what am i to tell you i have known rodion for a year and a half he is morose gloomy proud and haughty and of late and perhaps for a long time before he has been suspicious and fanciful he has a noble nature and a kind heart he does not like showing his feelings and would rather do a cruel thing than open his heart freely sometimes though he is not at all morbid but simply cold and inhumanly callous it s as though he were alternating between two characters sometimes he is fearfully reserved he says he is so busy that everything is a hindrance and yet he lies in bed doing nothing he doesn t jeer at things not because he hasn t the wit but as though he hadn t time to waste on such trifles he never listens to what is said to him he is never interested in what interests other people at any given moment he thinks very highly of himself and perhaps he is right well what more i think your arrival will have a most beneficial influence upon him god grant it may cried pulcheria alexandrovna distressed by razumihin s account of her rodya and razumihin ventured to look more boldly at avdotya romanovna at last he glanced at her often while he was talking but only for a moment and looked away again at once avdotya romanovna sat at the table listening attentively then got up again and began walking to and fro with her arms folded and her lips compressed occasionally putting in a question without stopping her walk she had the same habit of not listening to what was said she was wearing a dress of thin dark stuff and she had a white transparent scarf round her neck razumihin soon detected signs of extreme poverty in their belongings had avdotya romanovna been dressed like a queen he felt that he would not be afraid of her but perhaps just because she was poorly dressed and that he noticed all the misery of her surroundings his heart was filled with dread and he began to be afraid of every word he uttered every gesture he made which was very trying for a man who already felt diffident you ve told us a great deal that is interesting about my brother s character and have told it impartially i am glad i thought that you were too uncritically devoted to him observed avdotya romanovna with a smile i think you are right that he needs a woman s care she added thoughtfully i didn t say so but i daresay you are right only what he loves no one and perhaps he never will razumihin declared decisively you mean he is not capable of love do you know avdotya romanovna you are awfully like your brother in everything indeed he blurted out suddenly to his own surprise but remembering at once what he had just before said of her brother he turned as red as a crab and was overcome with confusion avdotya romanovna couldn t help laughing when she looked at him you may both be mistaken about rodya pulcheria alexandrovna remarked slightly piqued i am not talking of our present difficulty dounia what pyotr petrovitch writes in this letter and what you and i have supposed may be mistaken but you can t imagine dmitri prokofitch how moody and so to say capricious he is i never could depend on what he would do when he was only fifteen and i am sure that he might do something now that nobody else would think of doing well for instance do you know how a year and a half ago he astounded me and gave me a shock that nearly killed me when he had the idea of marrying that girl what was her name his landlady s daughter did you hear about that affair asked avdotya romanovna do you suppose pulcheria alexandrovna continued warmly do you suppose that my tears my entreaties my illness my possible death from grief our poverty would have made him pause no he would calmly have disregarded all obstacles and yet it isn t that he doesn t love us he has never spoken a word of that affair to me razumihin answered cautiously but i did hear something from praskovya pavlovna herself though she is by no means a gossip and what i heard certainly was rather strange and what did you hear both the ladies asked at once well nothing very special i only learned that the marriage which only failed to take place through the girl s death was not at all to praskovya pavlovna s liking they say too the girl was not at all pretty in fact i am told positively ugly and such an invalid and queer but she seems to have had some good qualities she must have had some good qualities or it s quite inexplicable she had no money either and he wouldn t have considered her money but it s always difficult to judge in such matters i am sure she was a good girl avdotya romanovna observed briefly god forgive me i simply rejoiced at her death though i don t know which of them would have caused most misery to the other he to her or she to him pulcheria alexandrovna concluded then she began tentatively questioning him about the scene on the previous day with luzhin hesitating and continually glancing at dounia obviously to the latter s annoyance this incident more than all the rest evidently caused her uneasiness even consternation razumihin described it in detail again but this time he added his own conclusions he openly blamed raskolnikov for intentionally insulting pyotr petrovitch not seeking to excuse him on the score of his illness he had planned it before his illness he added i think so too pulcheria alexandrovna agreed with a dejected air but she was very much surprised at hearing razumihin express himself so carefully and even with a certain respect about pyotr petrovitch avdotya romanovna too was struck by it so this is your opinion of pyotr petrovitch pulcheria alexandrovna could not resist asking i can have no other opinion of your daughter s future husband razumihin answered firmly and with warmth and i don t say it simply from vulgar politeness but because simply because avdotya romanovna has of her own free will deigned to accept this man if i spoke so rudely of him last night it was because i was disgustingly drunk and mad besides yes mad crazy i lost my head completely and this morning i am ashamed of it he crimsoned and ceased speaking avdotya romanovna flushed but did not break the silence she had not uttered a word from the moment they began to speak of luzhin without her support pulcheria alexandrovna obviously did not know what to do at last faltering and continually glancing at her daughter she confessed that she was exceedingly worried by one circumstance you see dmitri prokofitch she began i ll be perfectly open with dmitri prokofitch dounia of course mother said avdotya romanovna emphatically this is what it is she began in haste as though the permission to speak of her trouble lifted a weight off her mind very early this morning we got a note from pyotr petrovitch in reply to our letter announcing our arrival he promised to meet us at the station you know instead of that he sent a servant to bring us the address of these lodgings and to show us the way and he sent a message that he would be here himself this morning but this morning this note came from him you d better read it yourself there is one point in it which worries me very much you will soon see what that is and tell me your candid opinion dmitri prokofitch you know rodya s character better than anyone and no one can advise us better than you can dounia i must tell you made her decision at once but i still don t feel sure how to act and i i ve been waiting for your opinion razumihin opened the note which was dated the previous evening and read as follows dear madam pulcheria alexandrovna i have the honour to inform you that owing to unforeseen obstacles i was rendered unable to meet you at the railway station i sent a very competent person with the same object in view i likewise shall be deprived of the honour of an interview with you to morrow morning by business in the senate that does not admit of delay and also that i may not intrude on your family circle while you are meeting your son and avdotya romanovna her brother i shall have the honour of visiting you and paying you my respects at your lodgings not later than to morrow evening at eight o clock precisely and herewith i venture to present my earnest and i may add imperative request that rodion romanovitch may not be present at our interview as he offered me a gross and unprecedented affront on the occasion of my visit to him in his illness yesterday and moreover since i desire from you personally an indispensable and circumstantial explanation upon a certain point in regard to which i wish to learn your own interpretation i have the honour to inform you in anticipation that if in spite of my request i meet rodion romanovitch i shall be compelled to withdraw immediately and then you have only yourself to blame i write on the assumption that rodion romanovitch who appeared so ill at my visit suddenly recovered two hours later and so being able to leave the house may visit you also i was confirmed in that belief by the testimony of my own eyes in the lodging of a drunken man who was run over and has since died to whose daughter a young woman of notorious behaviour he gave twenty five roubles on the pretext of the funeral which gravely surprised me knowing what pains you were at to raise that sum herewith expressing my special respect to your estimable daughter avdotya romanovna i beg you to accept the respectful homage of your humble servant p luzhin what am i to do now dmitri prokofitch began pulcheria alexandrovna almost weeping how can i ask rodya not to come yesterday he insisted so earnestly on our refusing pyotr petrovitch and now we are ordered not to receive rodya he will come on purpose if he knows and what will happen then act on avdotya romanovna s decision razumihin answered calmly at once oh dear me she says goodness knows what she says she doesn t explain her object she says that it would be best at least not that it would be best but that it s absolutely necessary that rodya should make a point of being here at eight o clock and that they must meet i didn t want even to show him the letter but to prevent him from coming by some stratagem with your help because he is so irritable besides i don t understand about that drunkard who died and that daughter and how he could have given the daughter all the money which which cost you such sacrifice mother put in avdotya romanovna he was not himself yesterday razumihin said thoughtfully if you only knew what he was up to in a restaurant yesterday though there was sense in it too hm he did say something as we were going home yesterday evening about a dead man and a girl but i didn t understand a word but last night i myself the best thing mother will be for us to go to him ourselves and there i assure you we shall see at once what s to be done besides it s getting late good heavens it s past ten she cried looking at a splendid gold enamelled watch which hung round her neck on a thin venetian chain and looked entirely out of keeping with the rest of her dress a present from her fiance thought razumihin we must start dounia we must start her mother cried in a flutter he will be thinking we are still angry after yesterday from our coming so late merciful heavens while she said this she was hurriedly putting on her hat and mantle dounia too put on her things her gloves as razumihin noticed were not merely shabby but had holes in them and yet this evident poverty gave the two ladies an air of special dignity which is always found in people who know how to wear poor clothes razumihin looked reverently at dounia and felt proud of escorting her the queen who mended her stockings in prison he thought must have looked then every inch a queen and even more a queen than at sumptuous banquets and levees my god exclaimed pulcheria alexandrovna little did i think that i should ever fear seeing my son my darling darling rodya i am afraid dmitri prokofitch she added glancing at him timidly don t be afraid mother said dounia kissing her better have faith in him oh dear i have faith in him but i haven t slept all night exclaimed the poor woman they came out into the street do you know dounia when i dozed a little this morning i dreamed of marfa petrovna she was all in white she came up to me took my hand and shook her head at me but so sternly as though she were blaming me is that a good omen oh dear me you don t know dmitri prokofitch that marfa petrovna s dead no i didn t know who is marfa petrovna she died suddenly and only fancy afterwards mamma put in dounia he doesn t know who marfa petrovna is ah you don t know and i was thinking that you knew all about us forgive me dmitri prokofitch i don t know what i am thinking about these last few days i look upon you really as a providence for us and so i took it for granted that you knew all about us i look on you as a relation don t be angry with me for saying so dear me what s the matter with your right hand have you knocked it yes i bruised it muttered razumihin overjoyed i sometimes speak too much from the heart so that dounia finds fault with me but dear me what a cupboard he lives in i wonder whether he is awake does this woman his landlady consider it a room listen you say he does not like to show his feelings so perhaps i shall annoy him with my weaknesses do advise me dmitri prokofitch how am i to treat him i feel quite distracted you know don t question him too much about anything if you see him frown don t ask him too much about his health he doesn t like that ah dmitri prokofitch how hard it is to be a mother but here are the stairs what an awful staircase mother you are quite pale don t distress yourself darling said dounia caressing her then with flashing eyes she added he ought to be happy at seeing you and you are tormenting yourself so wait i ll peep in and see whether he has waked up the ladies slowly followed razumihin who went on before and when they reached the landlady s door on the fourth storey they noticed that her door was a tiny crack open and that two keen black eyes were watching them from the darkness within when their eyes met the door was suddenly shut with such a slam that pulcheria alexandrovna almost cried out chapter iii he is well quite well zossimov cried cheerfully as they entered he had come in ten minutes earlier and was sitting in the same place as before on the sofa raskolnikov was sitting in the opposite corner fully dressed and carefully washed and combed as he had not been for some time past the room was immediately crowded yet nastasya managed to follow the visitors in and stayed to listen raskolnikov really was almost well as compared with his condition the day before but he was still pale listless and sombre he looked like a wounded man or one who has undergone some terrible physical suffering his brows were knitted his lips compressed his eyes feverish he spoke little and reluctantly as though performing a duty and there was a restlessness in his movements he only wanted a sling on his arm or a bandage on his finger to complete the impression of a man with a painful abscess or a broken arm the pale sombre face lighted up for a moment when his mother and sister entered but this only gave it a look of more intense suffering in place of its listless dejection the light soon died away but the look of suffering remained and zossimov watching and studying his patient with all the zest of a young doctor beginning to practise noticed in him no joy at the arrival of his mother and sister but a sort of bitter hidden determination to bear another hour or two of inevitable torture he saw later that almost every word of the following conversation seemed to touch on some sore place and irritate it but at the same time he marvelled at the power of controlling himself and hiding his feelings in a patient who the previous day had like a monomaniac fallen into a frenzy at the slightest word yes i see myself now that i am almost well said raskolnikov giving his mother and sister a kiss of welcome which made pulcheria alexandrovna radiant at once and i don t say this as i did yesterday he said addressing razumihin with a friendly pressure of his hand yes indeed i am quite surprised at him to day began zossimov much delighted at the ladies entrance for he had not succeeded in keeping up a conversation with his patient for ten minutes in another three or four days if he goes on like this he will be just as before that is as he was a month ago or two or perhaps even three this has been coming on for a long while eh confess now that it has been perhaps your own fault he added with a tentative smile as though still afraid of irritating him it is very possible answered raskolnikov coldly i should say too continued zossimov with zest that your complete recovery depends solely on yourself now that one can talk to you i should like to impress upon you that it is essential to avoid the elementary so to speak fundamental causes tending to produce your morbid condition in that case you will be cured if not it will go from bad to worse these fundamental causes i don t know but they must be known to you you are an intelligent man and must have observed yourself of course i fancy the first stage of your derangement coincides with your leaving the university you must not be left without occupation and so work and a definite aim set before you might i fancy be very beneficial yes yes you are perfectly right i will make haste and return to the university and then everything will go smoothly zossimov who had begun his sage advice partly to make an effect before the ladies was certainly somewhat mystified when glancing at his patient he observed unmistakable mockery on his face this lasted an instant however pulcheria alexandrovna began at once thanking zossimov especially for his visit to their lodging the previous night what he saw you last night raskolnikov asked as though startled then you have not slept either after your journey ach rodya that was only till two o clock dounia and i never go to bed before two at home i don t know how to thank him either raskolnikov went on suddenly frowning and looking down setting aside the question of payment forgive me for referring to it he turned to zossimov i really don t know what i have done to deserve such special attention from you i simply don t understand it and and it weighs upon me indeed because i don t understand it i tell you so candidly don t be irritated zossimov forced himself to laugh assume that you are my first patient well we fellows just beginning to practise love our first patients as if they were our children and some almost fall in love with them and of course i am not rich in patients i say nothing about him added raskolnikov pointing to razumihin though he has had nothing from me either but insult and trouble what nonsense he is talking why you are in a sentimental mood to day are you shouted razumihin if he had had more penetration he would have seen that there was no trace of sentimentality in him but something indeed quite the opposite but avdotya romanovna noticed it she was intently and uneasily watching her brother as for you mother i don t dare to speak he went on as though repeating a lesson learned by heart it is only to day that i have been able to realise a little how distressed you must have been here yesterday waiting for me to come back when he had said this he suddenly held out his hand to his sister smiling without a word but in this smile there was a flash of real unfeigned feeling dounia caught it at once and warmly pressed his hand overjoyed and thankful it was the first time he had addressed her since their dispute the previous day the mother s face lighted up with ecstatic happiness at the sight of this conclusive unspoken reconciliation yes that is what i love him for razumihin exaggerating it all muttered to himself with a vigorous turn in his chair he has these movements and how well he does it all the mother was thinking to herself what generous impulses he has and how simply how delicately he put an end to all the misunderstanding with his sister simply by holding out his hand at the right minute and looking at her like that and what fine eyes he has and how fine his whole face is he is even better looking than dounia but good heavens what a suit how terribly he s dressed vasya the messenger boy in afanasy ivanitch s shop is better dressed i could rush at him and hug him weep over him but i am afraid oh dear he s so strange he s talking kindly but i m afraid why what am i afraid of oh rodya you wouldn t believe she began suddenly in haste to answer his words to her how unhappy dounia and i were yesterday now that it s all over and done with and we are quite happy again i can tell you fancy we ran here almost straight from the train to embrace you and that woman ah here she is good morning nastasya she told us at once that you were lying in a high fever and had just run away from the doctor in delirium and they were looking for you in the streets you can t imagine how we felt i couldn t help thinking of the tragic end of lieutenant potanchikov a friend of your father s you can t remember him rodya who ran out in the same way in a high fever and fell into the well in the court yard and they couldn t pull him out till next day of course we exaggerated things we were on the point of rushing to find pyotr petrovitch to ask him to help because we were alone utterly alone she said plaintively and stopped short suddenly recollecting it was still somewhat dangerous to speak of pyotr petrovitch although we are quite happy again yes yes of course it s very annoying raskolnikov muttered in reply but with such a preoccupied and inattentive air that dounia gazed at him in perplexity what else was it i wanted to say he went on trying to recollect oh yes mother and you too dounia please don t think that i didn t mean to come and see you to day and was waiting for you to come first what are you saying rodya cried pulcheria alexandrovna she too was surprised is he answering us as a duty dounia wondered is he being reconciled and asking forgiveness as though he were performing a rite or repeating a lesson i ve only just waked up and wanted to go to you but was delayed owing to my clothes i forgot yesterday to ask her nastasya to wash out the blood i ve only just dressed blood what blood pulcheria alexandrovna asked in alarm oh nothing don t be uneasy it was when i was wandering about yesterday rather delirious i chanced upon a man who had been run over a clerk delirious but you remember everything razumihin interrupted that s true raskolnikov answered with special carefulness i remember everything even to the slightest detail and yet why i did that and went there and said that i can t clearly explain now a familiar phenomenon interposed zossimov actions are sometimes performed in a masterly and most cunning way while the direction of the actions is deranged and dependent on various morbid impressions it s like a dream perhaps it s a good thing really that he should think me almost a madman thought raskolnikov why people in perfect health act in the same way too observed dounia looking uneasily at zossimov there is some truth in your observation the latter replied in that sense we are certainly all not infrequently like madmen but with the slight difference that the deranged are somewhat madder for we must draw a line a normal man it is true hardly exists among dozens perhaps hundreds of thousands hardly one is to be met with at the word madman carelessly dropped by zossimov in his chatter on his favourite subject everyone frowned raskolnikov sat seeming not to pay attention plunged in thought with a strange smile on his pale lips he was still meditating on something well what about the man who was run over i interrupted you razumihin cried hastily what raskolnikov seemed to wake up oh i got spattered with blood helping to carry him to his lodging by the way mamma i did an unpardonable thing yesterday i was literally out of my mind i gave away all the money you sent me to his wife for the funeral she s a widow now in consumption a poor creature three little children starving nothing in the house there s a daughter too perhaps you d have given it yourself if you d seen them but i had no right to do it i admit especially as i knew how you needed the money yourself to help others one must have the right to do it or else crevez chiens si vous n etes pas contents he laughed that s right isn t it dounia no it s not answered dounia firmly bah you too have ideals he muttered looking at her almost with hatred and smiling sarcastically i ought to have considered that well that s praiseworthy and it s better for you and if you reach a line you won t overstep you will be unhappy and if you overstep it maybe you will be still unhappier but all that s nonsense he added irritably vexed at being carried away i only meant to say that i beg your forgiveness mother he concluded shortly and abruptly that s enough rodya i am sure that everything you do is very good said his mother delighted don t be too sure he answered twisting his mouth into a smile a silence followed there was a certain constraint in all this conversation and in the silence and in the reconciliation and in the forgiveness and all were feeling it it is as though they were afraid of me raskolnikov was thinking to himself looking askance at his mother and sister pulcheria alexandrovna was indeed growing more timid the longer she kept silent yet in their absence i seemed to love them so much flashed through his mind do you know rodya marfa petrovna is dead pulcheria alexandrovna suddenly blurted out what marfa petrovna oh mercy on us marfa petrovna svidrigailov i wrote you so much about her a a h yes i remember so she s dead oh really he roused himself suddenly as if waking up what did she die of only imagine quite suddenly pulcheria alexandrovna answered hurriedly encouraged by his curiosity on the very day i was sending you that letter would you believe it that awful man seems to have been the cause of her death they say he beat her dreadfully why were they on such bad terms he asked addressing his sister not at all quite the contrary indeed with her he was always very patient considerate even in fact all those seven years of their married life he gave way to her too much so indeed in many cases all of a sudden he seems to have lost patience then he could not have been so awful if he controlled himself for seven years you seem to be defending him dounia no no he s an awful man i can imagine nothing more awful dounia answered almost with a shudder knitting her brows and sinking into thought that had happened in the morning pulcheria alexandrovna went on hurriedly and directly afterwards she ordered the horses to be harnessed to drive to the town immediately after dinner she always used to drive to the town in such cases she ate a very good dinner i am told after the beating that was always her habit and immediately after dinner so as not to be late in starting she went to the bath house you see she was undergoing some treatment with baths they have a cold spring there and she used to bathe in it regularly every day and no sooner had she got into the water when she suddenly had a stroke i should think so said zossimov and did he beat her badly what does that matter put in dounia h m but i don t know why you want to tell us such gossip mother said raskolnikov irritably as it were in spite of himself ah my dear i don t know what to talk about broke from pulcheria alexandrovna why are you all afraid of me he asked with a constrained smile that s certainly true said dounia looking directly and sternly at her brother mother was crossing herself with terror as she came up the stairs his face worked as though in convulsion ach what are you saying dounia don t be angry please rodya why did you say that dounia pulcheria alexandrovna began overwhelmed you see coming here i was dreaming all the way in the train how we should meet how we should talk over everything together and i was so happy i did not notice the journey but what am i saying i am happy now you should not dounia i am happy now simply in seeing you rodya hush mother he muttered in confusion not looking at her but pressing her hand we shall have time to speak freely of everything as he said this he was suddenly overwhelmed with confusion and turned pale again that awful sensation he had known of late passed with deadly chill over his soul again it became suddenly plain and perceptible to him that he had just told a fearful lie that he would never now be able to speak freely of everything that he would never again be able to speak of anything to anyone the anguish of this thought was such that for a moment he almost forgot himself he got up from his seat and not looking at anyone walked towards the door what are you about cried razumihin clutching him by the arm he sat down again and began looking about him in silence they were all looking at him in perplexity but what are you all so dull for he shouted suddenly and quite unexpectedly do say something what s the use of sitting like this come do speak let us talk we meet together and sit in silence come anything thank god i was afraid the same thing as yesterday was beginning again said pulcheria alexandrovna crossing herself what is the matter rodya asked avdotya romanovna distrustfully oh nothing i remembered something he answered and suddenly laughed well if you remembered something that s all right i was beginning to think muttered zossimov getting up from the sofa it is time for me to be off i will look in again perhaps if i can he made his bows and went out what an excellent man observed pulcheria alexandrovna yes excellent splendid well educated intelligent raskolnikov began suddenly speaking with surprising rapidity and a liveliness he had not shown till then i can t remember where i met him before my illness i believe i have met him somewhere and this is a good man too he nodded at razumihin do you like him dounia he asked her and suddenly for some unknown reason laughed very much answered dounia foo what a pig you are razumihin protested blushing in terrible confusion and he got up from his chair pulcheria alexandrovna smiled faintly but raskolnikov laughed aloud where are you off to i must go you need not at all stay zossimov has gone so you must don t go what s the time is it twelve o clock what a pretty watch you have got dounia but why are you all silent again i do all the talking it was a present from marfa petrovna answered dounia and a very expensive one added pulcheria alexandrovna a ah what a big one hardly like a lady s i like that sort said dounia so it is not a present from her fiance thought razumihin and was unreasonably delighted i thought it was luzhin s present observed raskolnikov no he has not made dounia any presents yet a ah and do you remember mother i was in love and wanted to get married he said suddenly looking at his mother who was disconcerted by the sudden change of subject and the way he spoke of it oh yes my dear pulcheria alexandrovna exchanged glances with dounia and razumihin h m yes what shall i tell you i don t remember much indeed she was such a sickly girl he went on growing dreamy and looking down again quite an invalid she was fond of giving alms to the poor and was always dreaming of a nunnery and once she burst into tears when she began talking to me about it yes yes i remember i remember very well she was an ugly little thing i really don t know what drew me to her then i think it was because she was always ill if she had been lame or hunchback i believe i should have liked her better still he smiled dreamily yes it was a sort of spring delirium no it was not only spring delirium said dounia with warm feeling he fixed a strained intent look on his sister but did not hear or did not understand her words then completely lost in thought he got up went up to his mother kissed her went back to his place and sat down you love her even now said pulcheria alexandrovna touched her now oh yes you ask about her no that s all now as it were in another world and so long ago and indeed everything happening here seems somehow far away he looked attentively at them you now i seem to be looking at you from a thousand miles away but goodness knows why we are talking of that and what s the use of asking about it he added with annoyance and biting his nails fell into dreamy silence again what a wretched lodging you have rodya it s like a tomb said pulcheria alexandrovna suddenly breaking the oppressive silence i am sure it s quite half through your lodging you have become so melancholy my lodging he answered listlessly yes the lodging had a great deal to do with it i thought that too if only you knew though what a strange thing you said just now mother he said laughing strangely a little more and their companionship this mother and this sister with him after three years absence this intimate tone of conversation in face of the utter impossibility of really speaking about anything would have been beyond his power of endurance but there was one urgent matter which must be settled one way or the other that day so he had decided when he woke now he was glad to remember it as a means of escape listen dounia he began gravely and drily of course i beg your pardon for yesterday but i consider it my duty to tell you again that i do not withdraw from my chief point it is me or luzhin if i am a scoundrel you must not be one is enough if you marry luzhin i cease at once to look on you as a sister rodya rodya it is the same as yesterday again pulcheria alexandrovna cried mournfully and why do you call yourself a scoundrel i can t bear it you said the same yesterday brother dounia answered firmly and with the same dryness in all this there is a mistake on your part i thought it over at night and found out the mistake it is all because you seem to fancy i am sacrificing myself to someone and for someone that is not the case at all i am simply marrying for my own sake because things are hard for me though of course i shall be glad if i succeed in being useful to my family but that is not the chief motive for my decision she is lying he thought to himself biting his nails vindictively proud creature she won t admit she wants to do it out of charity too haughty oh base characters they even love as though they hate oh how i hate them all in fact continued dounia i am marrying pyotr petrovitch because of two evils i choose the less i intend to do honestly all he expects of me so i am not deceiving him why did you smile just now she too flushed and there was a gleam of anger in her eyes all he asked with a malignant grin within certain limits both the manner and form of pyotr petrovitch s courtship showed me at once what he wanted he may of course think too well of himself but i hope he esteems me too why are you laughing again and why are you blushing again you are lying sister you are intentionally lying simply from feminine obstinacy simply to hold your own against me you cannot respect luzhin i have seen him and talked with him so you are selling yourself for money and so in any case you are acting basely and i am glad at least that you can blush for it it is not true i am not lying cried dounia losing her composure i would not marry him if i were not convinced that he esteems me and thinks highly of me i would not marry him if i were not firmly convinced that i can respect him fortunately i can have convincing proof of it this very day and such a marriage is not a vileness as you say and even if you were right if i really had determined on a vile action is it not merciless on your part to speak to me like that why do you demand of me a heroism that perhaps you have not either it is despotism it is tyranny if i ruin anyone it is only myself i am not committing a murder why do you look at me like that why are you so pale rodya darling what s the matter good heavens you have made him faint cried pulcheria alexandrovna no no nonsense it s nothing a little giddiness not fainting you have fainting on the brain h m yes what was i saying oh yes in what way will you get convincing proof to day that you can respect him and that he esteems you as you said i think you said to day mother show rodya pyotr petrovitch s letter said dounia with trembling hands pulcheria alexandrovna gave him the letter he took it with great interest but before opening it he suddenly looked with a sort of wonder at dounia it is strange he said slowly as though struck by a new idea what am i making such a fuss for what is it all about marry whom you like he said this as though to himself but said it aloud and looked for some time at his sister as though puzzled he opened the letter at last still with the same look of strange wonder on his face then slowly and attentively he began reading and read it through twice pulcheria alexandrovna showed marked anxiety and all indeed expected something particular what surprises me he began after a short pause handing the letter to his mother but not addressing anyone in particular is that he is a business man a lawyer and his conversation is pretentious indeed and yet he writes such an uneducated letter they all started they had expected something quite different but they all write like that you know razumihin observed abruptly have you read it yes we showed him rodya we consulted him just now pulcheria alexandrovna began embarrassed that s just the jargon of the courts razumihin put in legal documents are written like that to this day legal yes it s just legal business language not so very uneducated and not quite educated business language pyotr petrovitch makes no secret of the fact that he had a cheap education he is proud indeed of having made his own way avdotya romanovna observed somewhat offended by her brother s tone well if he s proud of it he has reason i don t deny it you seem to be offended sister at my making only such a frivolous criticism on the letter and to think that i speak of such trifling matters on purpose to annoy you it is quite the contrary an observation apropos of the style occurred to me that is by no means irrelevant as things stand there is one expression blame yourselves put in very significantly and plainly and there is besides a threat that he will go away at once if i am present that threat to go away is equivalent to a threat to abandon you both if you are disobedient and to abandon you now after summoning you to petersburg well what do you think can one resent such an expression from luzhin as we should if he he pointed to razumihin had written it or zossimov or one of us n no answered dounia with more animation i saw clearly that it was too naively expressed and that perhaps he simply has no skill in writing that is a true criticism brother i did not expect indeed it is expressed in legal style and sounds coarser than perhaps he intended but i must disillusion you a little there is one expression in the letter one slander about me and rather a contemptible one i gave the money last night to the widow a woman in consumption crushed with trouble and not on the pretext of the funeral but simply to pay for the funeral and not to the daughter a young woman as he writes of notorious behaviour whom i saw last night for the first time in my life but to the widow in all this i see a too hasty desire to slander me and to raise dissension between us it is expressed again in legal jargon that is to say with a too obvious display of the aim and with a very naive eagerness he is a man of intelligence but to act sensibly intelligence is not enough it all shows the man and i don t think he has a great esteem for you i tell you this simply to warn you because i sincerely wish for your good dounia did not reply her resolution had been taken she was only awaiting the evening then what is your decision rodya asked pulcheria alexandrovna who was more uneasy than ever at the sudden new businesslike tone of his talk what decision you see pyotr petrovitch writes that you are not to be with us this evening and that he will go away if you come so will you come that of course is not for me to decide but for you first if you are not offended by such a request and secondly by dounia if she too is not offended i will do what you think best he added drily dounia has already decided and i fully agree with her pulcheria alexandrovna hastened to declare i decided to ask you rodya to urge you not to fail to be with us at this interview said dounia will you come yes i will ask you too to be with us at eight o clock she said addressing razumihin mother i am inviting him too quite right dounia well since you have decided added pulcheria alexandrovna so be it i shall feel easier myself i do not like concealment and deception better let us have the whole truth pyotr petrovitch may be angry or not now chapter iv at that moment the door was softly opened and a young girl walked into the room looking timidly about her everyone turned towards her with surprise and curiosity at first sight raskolnikov did not recognise her it was sofya semyonovna marmeladov he had seen her yesterday for the first time but at such a moment in such surroundings and in such a dress that his memory retained a very different image of her now she was a modestly and poorly dressed young girl very young indeed almost like a child with a modest and refined manner with a candid but somewhat frightened looking face she was wearing a very plain indoor dress and had on a shabby old fashioned hat but she still carried a parasol unexpectedly finding the room full of people she was not so much embarrassed as completely overwhelmed with shyness like a little child she was even about to retreat oh it s you said raskolnikov extremely astonished and he too was confused he at once recollected that his mother and sister knew through luzhin s letter of some young woman of notorious behaviour he had only just been protesting against luzhin s calumny and declaring that he had seen the girl last night for the first time and suddenly she had walked in he remembered too that he had not protested against the expression of notorious behaviour all this passed vaguely and fleetingly through his brain but looking at her more intently he saw that the humiliated creature was so humiliated that he felt suddenly sorry for her when she made a movement to retreat in terror it sent a pang to his heart i did not expect you he said hurriedly with a look that made her stop please sit down you come no doubt from katerina ivanovna allow me not there sit here at sonia s entrance razumihin who had been sitting on one of raskolnikov s three chairs close to the door got up to allow her to enter raskolnikov had at first shown her the place on the sofa where zossimov had been sitting but feeling that the sofa which served him as a bed was too familiar a place he hurriedly motioned her to razumihin s chair you sit here he said to razumihin putting him on the sofa sonia sat down almost shaking with terror and looked timidly at the two ladies it was evidently almost inconceivable to herself that she could sit down beside them at the thought of it she was so frightened that she hurriedly got up again and in utter confusion addressed raskolnikov i i have come for one minute forgive me for disturbing you she began falteringly i come from katerina ivanovna and she had no one to send katerina ivanovna told me to beg you to be at the service in the morning at mitrofanievsky and then to us to her to do her the honour she told me to beg you sonia stammered and ceased speaking i will try certainly most certainly answered raskolnikov he too stood up and he too faltered and could not finish his sentence please sit down he said suddenly i want to talk to you you are perhaps in a hurry but please be so kind spare me two minutes and he drew up a chair for her sonia sat down again and again timidly she took a hurried frightened look at the two ladies and dropped her eyes raskolnikov s pale face flushed a shudder passed over him his eyes glowed mother he said firmly and insistently this is sofya semyonovna marmeladov the daughter of that unfortunate mr marmeladov who was run over yesterday before my eyes and of whom i was just telling you pulcheria alexandrovna glanced at sonia and slightly screwed up her eyes in spite of her embarrassment before rodya s urgent and challenging look she could not deny herself that satisfaction dounia gazed gravely and intently into the poor girl s face and scrutinised her with perplexity sonia hearing herself introduced tried to raise her eyes again but was more embarrassed than ever i wanted to ask you said raskolnikov hastily how things were arranged yesterday you were not worried by the police for instance no that was all right it was too evident the cause of death they did not worry us only the lodgers are angry why at the body s remaining so long you see it is hot now so that to day they will carry it to the cemetery into the chapel until to morrow at first katerina ivanovna was unwilling but now she sees herself that it s necessary to day then she begs you to do us the honour to be in the church to morrow for the service and then to be present at the funeral lunch she is giving a funeral lunch yes just a little she told me to thank you very much for helping us yesterday but for you we should have had nothing for the funeral all at once her lips and chin began trembling but with an effort she controlled herself looking down again during the conversation raskolnikov watched her carefully she had a thin very thin pale little face rather irregular and angular with a sharp little nose and chin she could not have been called pretty but her blue eyes were so clear and when they lighted up there was such a kindliness and simplicity in her expression that one could not help being attracted her face and her whole figure indeed had another peculiar characteristic in spite of her eighteen years she looked almost a little girl almost a child and in some of her gestures this childishness seemed almost absurd but has katerina ivanovna been able to manage with such small means does she even mean to have a funeral lunch raskolnikov asked persistently keeping up the conversation the coffin will be plain of course and everything will be plain so it won t cost much katerina ivanovna and i have reckoned it all out so that there will be enough left and katerina ivanovna was very anxious it should be so you know one can t it s a comfort to her she is like that you know i understand i understand of course why do you look at my room like that my mother has just said it is like a tomb you gave us everything yesterday sonia said suddenly in reply in a loud rapid whisper and again she looked down in confusion her lips and chin were trembling once more she had been struck at once by raskolnikov s poor surroundings and now these words broke out spontaneously a silence followed there was a light in dounia s eyes and even pulcheria alexandrovna looked kindly at sonia rodya she said getting up we shall have dinner together of course come dounia and you rodya had better go for a little walk and then rest and lie down before you come to see us i am afraid we have exhausted you yes yes i ll come he answered getting up fussily but i have something to see to but surely you will have dinner together cried razumihin looking in surprise at raskolnikov what do you mean yes yes i am coming of course of course and you stay a minute you do not want him just now do you mother or perhaps i am taking him from you oh no no and will you dmitri prokofitch do us the favour of dining with us please do added dounia razumihin bowed positively radiant for one moment they were all strangely embarrassed good bye rodya that is till we meet i do not like saying good bye good bye nastasya ah i have said good bye again pulcheria alexandrovna meant to greet sonia too but it somehow failed to come off and she went in a flutter out of the room but avdotya romanovna seemed to await her turn and following her mother out gave sonia an attentive courteous bow sonia in confusion gave a hurried frightened curtsy there was a look of poignant discomfort in her face as though avdotya romanovna s courtesy and attention were oppressive and painful to her dounia good bye called raskolnikov in the passage give me your hand why i did give it to you have you forgotten said dounia turning warmly and awkwardly to him never mind give it to me again and he squeezed her fingers warmly dounia smiled flushed pulled her hand away and went off quite happy come that s capital he said to sonia going back and looking brightly at her god give peace to the dead the living have still to live that is right isn t it sonia looked surprised at the sudden brightness of his face he looked at her for some moments in silence the whole history of the dead father floated before his memory in those moments heavens dounia pulcheria alexandrovna began as soon as they were in the street i really feel relieved myself at coming away more at ease how little did i think yesterday in the train that i could ever be glad of that i tell you again mother he is still very ill don t you see it perhaps worrying about us upset him we must be patient and much much can be forgiven well you were not very patient pulcheria alexandrovna caught her up hotly and jealously do you know dounia i was looking at you two you are the very portrait of him and not so much in face as in soul you are both melancholy both morose and hot tempered both haughty and both generous surely he can t be an egoist dounia eh when i think of what is in store for us this evening my heart sinks don t be uneasy mother what must be will be dounia only think what a position we are in what if pyotr petrovitch breaks it off poor pulcheria alexandrovna blurted out incautiously he won t be worth much if he does answered dounia sharply and contemptuously we did well to come away pulcheria alexandrovna hurriedly broke in he was in a hurry about some business or other if he gets out and has a breath of air it is fearfully close in his room but where is one to get a breath of air here the very streets here feel like shut up rooms good heavens what a town stay this side they will crush you carrying something why it is a piano they have got i declare how they push i am very much afraid of that young woman too what young woman mother why that sofya semyonovna who was there just now why i have a presentiment dounia well you may believe it or not but as soon as she came in that very minute i felt that she was the chief cause of the trouble nothing of the sort cried dounia in vexation what nonsense with your presentiments mother he only made her acquaintance the evening before and he did not know her when she came in well you will see she worries me but you will see you will see i was so frightened she was gazing at me with those eyes i could scarcely sit still in my chair when he began introducing her do you remember it seems so strange but pyotr petrovitch writes like that about her and he introduces her to us to you so he must think a great deal of her people will write anything we were talked about and written about too have you forgotten i am sure that she is a good girl and that it is all nonsense god grant it may be and pyotr petrovitch is a contemptible slanderer dounia snapped out suddenly pulcheria alexandrovna was crushed the conversation was not resumed i will tell you what i want with you said raskolnikov drawing razumihin to the window then i will tell katerina ivanovna that you are coming sonia said hurriedly preparing to depart one minute sofya semyonovna we have no secrets you are not in our way i want to have another word or two with you listen he turned suddenly to razumihin again you know that what s his name porfiry petrovitch i should think so he is a relation why added the latter with interest is not he managing that case you know about that murder you were speaking about it yesterday yes well razumihin s eyes opened wide he was inquiring for people who had pawned things and i have some pledges there too trifles a ring my sister gave me as a keepsake when i left home and my father s silver watch they are only worth five or six roubles altogether but i value them so what am i to do now i do not want to lose the things especially the watch i was quaking just now for fear mother would ask to look at it when we spoke of dounia s watch it is the only thing of father s left us she would be ill if it were lost you know what women are so tell me what to do i know i ought to have given notice at the police station but would it not be better to go straight to porfiry eh what do you think the matter might be settled more quickly you see mother may ask for it before dinner certainly not to the police station certainly to porfiry razumihin shouted in extraordinary excitement well how glad i am let us go at once it is a couple of steps we shall be sure to find him very well let us go and he will be very very glad to make your acquaintance i have often talked to him of you at different times i was speaking of you yesterday let us go so you knew the old woman so that s it it is all turning out splendidly oh yes sofya ivanovna sofya semyonovna corrected raskolnikov sofya semyonovna this is my friend razumihin and he is a good man if you have to go now sonia was beginning not looking at razumihin at all and still more embarrassed let us go decided raskolnikov i will come to you to day sofya semyonovna only tell me where you live he was not exactly ill at ease but seemed hurried and avoided her eyes sonia gave her address and flushed as she did so they all went out together don t you lock up asked razumihin following him on to the stairs never answered raskolnikov i have been meaning to buy a lock for these two years people are happy who have no need of locks he said laughing to sonia they stood still in the gateway do you go to the right sofya semyonovna how did you find me by the way he added as though he wanted to say something quite different he wanted to look at her soft clear eyes but this was not easy why you gave your address to polenka yesterday polenka oh yes polenka that is the little girl she is your sister did i give her the address why had you forgotten no i remember i had heard my father speak of you only i did not know your name and he did not know it and now i came and as i had learnt your name i asked to day where does mr raskolnikov live i did not know you had only a room too good bye i will tell katerina ivanovna she was extremely glad to escape at last she went away looking down hurrying to get out of sight as soon as possible to walk the twenty steps to the turning on the right and to be at last alone and then moving rapidly along looking at no one noticing nothing to think to remember to meditate on every word every detail never never had she felt anything like this dimly and unconsciously a whole new world was opening before her she remembered suddenly that raskolnikov meant to come to her that day perhaps at once only not to day please not to day she kept muttering with a sinking heart as though entreating someone like a frightened child mercy to me to that room he will see oh dear she was not capable at that instant of noticing an unknown gentleman who was watching her and following at her heels he had accompanied her from the gateway at the moment when razumihin raskolnikov and she stood still at parting on the pavement this gentleman who was just passing started on hearing sonia s words and i asked where mr raskolnikov lived he turned a rapid but attentive look upon all three especially upon raskolnikov to whom sonia was speaking then looked back and noted the house all this was done in an instant as he passed and trying not to betray his interest he walked on more slowly as though waiting for something he was waiting for sonia he saw that they were parting and that sonia was going home home where i ve seen that face somewhere he thought i must find out at the turning he crossed over looked round and saw sonia coming the same way noticing nothing she turned the corner he followed her on the other side after about fifty paces he crossed over again overtook her and kept two or three yards behind her he was a man about fifty rather tall and thickly set with broad high shoulders which made him look as though he stooped a little he wore good and fashionable clothes and looked like a gentleman of position he carried a handsome cane which he tapped on the pavement at each step his gloves were spotless he had a broad rather pleasant face with high cheek bones and a fresh colour not often seen in petersburg his flaxen hair was still abundant and only touched here and there with grey and his thick square beard was even lighter than his hair his eyes were blue and had a cold and thoughtful look his lips were crimson he was a remarkedly well preserved man and looked much younger than his years when sonia came out on the canal bank they were the only two persons on the pavement he observed her dreaminess and preoccupation on reaching the house where she lodged sonia turned in at the gate he followed her seeming rather surprised in the courtyard she turned to the right corner bah muttered the unknown gentleman and mounted the stairs behind her only then sonia noticed him she reached the third storey turned down the passage and rang at no on the door was inscribed in chalk kapernaumov tailor bah the stranger repeated again wondering at the strange coincidence and he rang next door at no the doors were two or three yards apart you lodge at kapernaumov s he said looking at sonia and laughing he altered a waistcoat for me yesterday i am staying close here at madame resslich s how odd sonia looked at him attentively we are neighbours he went on gaily i only came to town the day before yesterday good bye for the present sonia made no reply the door opened and she slipped in she felt for some reason ashamed and uneasy on the way to porfiry s razumihin was obviously excited that s capital brother he repeated several times and i am glad i am glad what are you glad about raskolnikov thought to himself i didn t know that you pledged things at the old woman s too and was it long ago i mean was it long since you were there what a simple hearted fool he is when was it raskolnikov stopped still to recollect two or three days before her death it must have been but i am not going to redeem the things now he put in with a sort of hurried and conspicuous solicitude about the things i ve not more than a silver rouble left after last night s accursed delirium he laid special emphasis on the delirium yes yes razumihin hastened to agree with what was not clear then that s why you were stuck partly you know in your delirium you were continually mentioning some rings or chains yes yes that s clear it s all clear now hullo how that idea must have got about among them here this man will go to the stake for me and i find him delighted at having it cleared up why i spoke of rings in my delirium what a hold the idea must have on all of them shall we find him he asked suddenly oh yes razumihin answered quickly he is a nice fellow you will see brother rather clumsy that is to say he is a man of polished manners but i mean clumsy in a different sense he is an intelligent fellow very much so indeed but he has his own range of ideas he is incredulous sceptical cynical he likes to impose on people or rather to make fun of them his is the old circumstantial method but he understands his work thoroughly last year he cleared up a case of murder in which the police had hardly a clue he is very very anxious to make your acquaintance on what grounds is he so anxious oh it s not exactly you see since you ve been ill i happen to have mentioned you several times so when he heard about you about your being a law student and not able to finish your studies he said what a pity and so i concluded from everything together not only that yesterday zametov you know rodya i talked some nonsense on the way home to you yesterday when i was drunk i am afraid brother of your exaggerating it you see what that they think i am a madman maybe they are right he said with a constrained smile yes yes that is pooh no but all that i said and there was something else too it was all nonsense drunken nonsense but why are you apologising i am so sick of it all raskolnikov cried with exaggerated irritability it was partly assumed however i know i know i understand believe me i understand one s ashamed to speak of it if you are ashamed then don t speak of it both were silent razumihin was more than ecstatic and raskolnikov perceived it with repulsion he was alarmed too by what razumihin had just said about porfiry i shall have to pull a long face with him too he thought with a beating heart and he turned white and do it naturally too but the most natural thing would be to do nothing at all carefully do nothing at all no carefully would not be natural again oh well we shall see how it turns out we shall see directly is it a good thing to go or not the butterfly flies to the light my heart is beating that s what s bad in this grey house said razumihin the most important thing does porfiry know that i was at the old hag s flat yesterday and asked about the blood i must find that out instantly as soon as i go in find out from his face otherwise i ll find out if it s my ruin i say brother he said suddenly addressing razumihin with a sly smile i have been noticing all day that you seem to be curiously excited isn t it so excited not a bit of it said razumihin stung to the quick yes brother i assure you it s noticeable why you sat on your chair in a way you never do sit on the edge somehow and you seemed to be writhing all the time you kept jumping up for nothing one moment you were angry and the next your face looked like a sweetmeat you even blushed especially when you were invited to dinner you blushed awfully nothing of the sort nonsense what do you mean but why are you wriggling out of it like a schoolboy by jove there he s blushing again what a pig you are but why are you so shamefaced about it romeo stay i ll tell of you to day ha ha ha i ll make mother laugh and someone else too listen listen listen this is serious what next you fiend razumihin was utterly overwhelmed turning cold with horror what will you tell them come brother foo what a pig you are you are like a summer rose and if only you knew how it suits you a romeo over six foot high and how you ve washed to day you cleaned your nails i declare eh that s something unheard of why i do believe you ve got pomatum on your hair bend down pig raskolnikov laughed as though he could not restrain himself so laughing they entered porfiry petrovitch s flat this is what raskolnikov wanted from within they could be heard laughing as they came in still guffawing in the passage not a word here or i ll brain you razumihin whispered furiously seizing raskolnikov by the shoulder chapter v raskolnikov was already entering the room he came in looking as though he had the utmost difficulty not to burst out laughing again behind him razumihin strode in gawky and awkward shamefaced and red as a peony with an utterly crestfallen and ferocious expression his face and whole figure really were ridiculous at that moment and amply justified raskolnikov s laughter raskolnikov not waiting for an introduction bowed to porfiry petrovitch who stood in the middle of the room looking inquiringly at them he held out his hand and shook hands still apparently making desperate efforts to subdue his mirth and utter a few words to introduce himself but he had no sooner succeeded in assuming a serious air and muttering something when he suddenly glanced again as though accidentally at razumihin and could no longer control himself his stifled laughter broke out the more irresistibly the more he tried to restrain it the extraordinary ferocity with which razumihin received this spontaneous mirth gave the whole scene the appearance of most genuine fun and naturalness razumihin strengthened this impression as though on purpose fool you fiend he roared waving his arm which at once struck a little round table with an empty tea glass on it everything was sent flying and crashing but why break chairs gentlemen you know it s a loss to the crown porfiry petrovitch quoted gaily raskolnikov was still laughing with his hand in porfiry petrovitch s but anxious not to overdo it awaited the right moment to put a natural end to it razumihin completely put to confusion by upsetting the table and smashing the glass gazed gloomily at the fragments cursed and turned sharply to the window where he stood looking out with his back to the company with a fiercely scowling countenance seeing nothing porfiry petrovitch laughed and was ready to go on laughing but obviously looked for explanations zametov had been sitting in the corner but he rose at the visitors entrance and was standing in expectation with a smile on his lips though he looked with surprise and even it seemed incredulity at the whole scene and at raskolnikov with a certain embarrassment zametov s unexpected presence struck raskolnikov unpleasantly i ve got to think of that he thought excuse me please he began affecting extreme embarrassment raskolnikov not at all very pleasant to see you and how pleasantly you ve come in why won t he even say good morning porfiry petrovitch nodded at razumihin upon my honour i don t know why he is in such a rage with me i only told him as we came along that he was like romeo and proved it and that was all i think pig ejaculated razumihin without turning round there must have been very grave grounds for it if he is so furious at the word porfiry laughed oh you sharp lawyer damn you all snapped razumihin and suddenly bursting out laughing himself he went up to porfiry with a more cheerful face as though nothing had happened that ll do we are all fools to come to business this is my friend rodion romanovitch raskolnikov in the first place he has heard of you and wants to make your acquaintance and secondly he has a little matter of business with you bah zametov what brought you here have you met before have you known each other long what does this mean thought raskolnikov uneasily zametov seemed taken aback but not very much so why it was at your rooms we met yesterday he said easily then i have been spared the trouble all last week he was begging me to introduce him to you porfiry and you have sniffed each other out without me where is your tobacco porfiry petrovitch was wearing a dressing gown very clean linen and trodden down slippers he was a man of about five and thirty short stout even to corpulence and clean shaven he wore his hair cut short and had a large round head particularly prominent at the back his soft round rather snub nosed face was of a sickly yellowish colour but had a vigorous and rather ironical expression it would have been good natured except for a look in the eyes which shone with a watery mawkish light under almost white blinking eyelashes the expression of those eyes was strangely out of keeping with his somewhat womanish figure and gave it something far more serious than could be guessed at first sight as soon as porfiry petrovitch heard that his visitor had a little matter of business with him he begged him to sit down on the sofa and sat down himself on the other end waiting for him to explain his business with that careful and over serious attention which is at once oppressive and embarrassing especially to a stranger and especially if what you are discussing is in your opinion of far too little importance for such exceptional solemnity but in brief and coherent phrases raskolnikov explained his business clearly and exactly and was so well satisfied with himself that he even succeeded in taking a good look at porfiry porfiry petrovitch did not once take his eyes off him razumihin sitting opposite at the same table listened warmly and impatiently looking from one to the other every moment with rather excessive interest fool raskolnikov swore to himself you have to give information to the police porfiry replied with a most businesslike air that having learnt of this incident that is of the murder you beg to inform the lawyer in charge of the case that such and such things belong to you and that you desire to redeem them or but they will write to you that s just the point that at the present moment raskolnikov tried his utmost to feign embarrassment i am not quite in funds and even this trifling sum is beyond me i only wanted you see for the present to declare that the things are mine and that when i have money that s no matter answered porfiry petrovitch receiving his explanation of his pecuniary position coldly but you can if you prefer write straight to me to say that having been informed of the matter and claiming such and such as your property you beg on an ordinary sheet of paper raskolnikov interrupted eagerly again interested in the financial side of the question oh the most ordinary and suddenly porfiry petrovitch looked with obvious irony at him screwing up his eyes and as it were winking at him but perhaps it was raskolnikov s fancy for it all lasted but a moment there was certainly something of the sort raskolnikov could have sworn he winked at him goodness knows why he knows flashed through his mind like lightning forgive my troubling you about such trifles he went on a little disconcerted the things are only worth five roubles but i prize them particularly for the sake of those from whom they came to me and i must confess that i was alarmed when i heard that s why you were so much struck when i mentioned to zossimov that porfiry was inquiring for everyone who had pledges razumihin put in with obvious intention this was really unbearable raskolnikov could not help glancing at him with a flash of vindictive anger in his black eyes but immediately recollected himself you seem to be jeering at me brother he said to him with a well feigned irritability i dare say i do seem to you absurdly anxious about such trash but you mustn t think me selfish or grasping for that and these two things may be anything but trash in my eyes i told you just now that the silver watch though it s not worth a cent is the only thing left us of my father s you may laugh at me but my mother is here he turned suddenly to porfiry and if she knew he turned again hurriedly to razumihin carefully making his voice tremble that the watch was lost she would be in despair you know what women are not a bit of it i didn t mean that at all quite the contrary shouted razumihin distressed was it right was it natural did i overdo it raskolnikov asked himself in a tremor why did i say that about women oh your mother is with you porfiry petrovitch inquired yes when did she come last night porfiry paused as though reflecting your things would not in any case be lost he went on calmly and coldly i have been expecting you here for some time and as though that was a matter of no importance he carefully offered the ash tray to razumihin who was ruthlessly scattering cigarette ash over the carpet raskolnikov shuddered but porfiry did not seem to be looking at him and was still concerned with razumihin s cigarette what expecting him why did you know that he had pledges there cried razumihin porfiry petrovitch addressed himself to raskolnikov your things the ring and the watch were wrapped up together and on the paper your name was legibly written in pencil together with the date on which you left them with her how observant you are raskolnikov smiled awkwardly doing his very utmost to look him straight in the face but he failed and suddenly added i say that because i suppose there were a great many pledges that it must be difficult to remember them all but you remember them all so clearly and and stupid feeble he thought why did i add that but we know all who had pledges and you are the only one who hasn t come forward porfiry answered with hardly perceptible irony i haven t been quite well i heard that too i heard indeed that you were in great distress about something you look pale still i am not pale at all no i am quite well raskolnikov snapped out rudely and angrily completely changing his tone his anger was mounting he could not repress it and in my anger i shall betray myself flashed through his mind again why are they torturing me not quite well razumihin caught him up what next he was unconscious and delirious all yesterday would you believe porfiry as soon as our backs were turned he dressed though he could hardly stand and gave us the slip and went off on a spree somewhere till midnight delirious all the time would you believe it extraordinary really delirious you don t say so porfiry shook his head in a womanish way nonsense don t you believe it but you don t believe it anyway raskolnikov let slip in his anger but porfiry petrovitch did not seem to catch those strange words but how could you have gone out if you hadn t been delirious razumihin got hot suddenly what did you go out for what was the object of it and why on the sly were you in your senses when you did it now that all danger is over i can speak plainly i was awfully sick of them yesterday raskolnikov addressed porfiry suddenly with a smile of insolent defiance i ran away from them to take lodgings where they wouldn t find me and took a lot of money with me mr zametov there saw it i say mr zametov was i sensible or delirious yesterday settle our dispute he could have strangled zametov at that moment so hateful were his expression and his silence to him in my opinion you talked sensibly and even artfully but you were extremely irritable zametov pronounced dryly and nikodim fomitch was telling me to day put in porfiry petrovitch that he met you very late last night in the lodging of a man who had been run over and there said razumihin weren t you mad then you gave your last penny to the widow for the funeral if you wanted to help give fifteen or twenty even but keep three roubles for yourself at least but he flung away all the twenty five at once maybe i found a treasure somewhere and you know nothing of it so that s why i was liberal yesterday mr zametov knows i ve found a treasure excuse us please for disturbing you for half an hour with such trivialities he said turning to porfiry petrovitch with trembling lips we are boring you aren t we oh no quite the contrary quite the contrary if only you knew how you interest me it s interesting to look on and listen and i am really glad you have come forward at last but you might give us some tea my throat s dry cried razumihin capital idea perhaps we will all keep you company wouldn t you like something more essential before tea get along with you porfiry petrovitch went out to order tea raskolnikov s thoughts were in a whirl he was in terrible exasperation the worst of it is they don t disguise it they don t care to stand on ceremony and how if you didn t know me at all did you come to talk to nikodim fomitch about me so they don t care to hide that they are tracking me like a pack of dogs they simply spit in my face he was shaking with rage come strike me openly don t play with me like a cat with a mouse it s hardly civil porfiry petrovitch but perhaps i won t allow it i shall get up and throw the whole truth in your ugly faces and you ll see how i despise you he could hardly breathe and what if it s only my fancy what if i am mistaken and through inexperience i get angry and don t keep up my nasty part perhaps it s all unintentional all their phrases are the usual ones but there is something about them it all might be said but there is something why did he say bluntly with her why did zametov add that i spoke artfully why do they speak in that tone yes the tone razumihin is sitting here why does he see nothing that innocent blockhead never does see anything feverish again did porfiry wink at me just now of course it s nonsense what could he wink for are they trying to upset my nerves or are they teasing me either it s ill fancy or they know even zametov is rude is zametov rude zametov has changed his mind i foresaw he would change his mind he is at home here while it s my first visit porfiry does not consider him a visitor sits with his back to him they re as thick as thieves no doubt over me not a doubt they were talking about me before we came do they know about the flat if only they d make haste when i said that i ran away to take a flat he let it pass i put that in cleverly about a flat it may be of use afterwards delirious indeed ha ha ha he knows all about last night he didn t know of my mother s arrival the hag had written the date on in pencil you are wrong you won t catch me there are no facts it s all supposition you produce facts the flat even isn t a fact but delirium i know what to say to them do they know about the flat i won t go without finding out what did i come for but my being angry now maybe is a fact fool how irritable i am perhaps that s right to play the invalid he is feeling me he will try to catch me why did i come all this flashed like lightning through his mind porfiry petrovitch returned quickly he became suddenly more jovial your party yesterday brother has left my head rather and i am out of sorts altogether he began in quite a different tone laughing to razumihin was it interesting i left you yesterday at the most interesting point who got the best of it oh no one of course they got on to everlasting questions floated off into space only fancy rodya what we got on to yesterday whether there is such a thing as crime i told you that we talked our heads off what is there strange it s an everyday social question raskolnikov answered casually the question wasn t put quite like that observed porfiry not quite that s true razumihin agreed at once getting warm and hurried as usual listen rodion and tell us your opinion i want to hear it i was fighting tooth and nail with them and wanted you to help me i told them you were coming it began with the socialist doctrine you know their doctrine crime is a protest against the abnormality of the social organisation and nothing more and nothing more no other causes admitted you are wrong there cried porfiry petrovitch he was noticeably animated and kept laughing as he looked at razumihin which made him more excited than ever nothing is admitted razumihin interrupted with heat i am not wrong i ll show you their pamphlets everything with them is the influence of environment and nothing else their favourite phrase from which it follows that if society is normally organised all crime will cease at once since there will be nothing to protest against and all men will become righteous in one instant human nature is not taken into account it is excluded it s not supposed to exist they don t recognise that humanity developing by a historical living process will become at last a normal society but they believe that a social system that has come out of some mathematical brain is going to organise all humanity at once and make it just and sinless in an instant quicker than any living process that s why they instinctively dislike history nothing but ugliness and stupidity in it and they explain it all as stupidity that s why they so dislike the living process of life they don t want a living soul the living soul demands life the soul won t obey the rules of mechanics the soul is an object of suspicion the soul is retrograde but what they want though it smells of death and can be made of india rubber at least is not alive has no will is servile and won t revolt and it comes in the end to their reducing everything to the building of walls and the planning of rooms and passages in a phalanstery the phalanstery is ready indeed but your human nature is not ready for the phalanstery it wants life it hasn t completed its vital process it s too soon for the graveyard you can t skip over nature by logic logic presupposes three possibilities but there are millions cut away a million and reduce it all to the question of comfort that s the easiest solution of the problem it s seductively clear and you musn t think about it that s the great thing you mustn t think the whole secret of life in two pages of print now he is off beating the drum catch hold of him do laughed porfiry can you imagine he turned to raskolnikov six people holding forth like that last night in one room with punch as a preliminary no brother you are wrong environment accounts for a great deal in crime i can assure you of that oh i know it does but just tell me a man of forty violates a child of ten was it environment drove him to it well strictly speaking it did porfiry observed with noteworthy gravity a crime of that nature may be very well ascribed to the influence of environment razumihin was almost in a frenzy oh if you like he roared i ll prove to you that your white eyelashes may very well be ascribed to the church of ivan the great s being two hundred and fifty feet high and i will prove it clearly exactly progressively and even with a liberal tendency i undertake to will you bet on it done let s hear please how he will prove it he is always humbugging confound him cried razumihin jumping up and gesticulating what s the use of talking to you he does all that on purpose you don t know him rodion he took their side yesterday simply to make fools of them and the things he said yesterday and they were delighted he can keep it up for a fortnight together last year he persuaded us that he was going into a monastery he stuck to it for two months not long ago he took it into his head to declare he was going to get married that he had everything ready for the wedding he ordered new clothes indeed we all began to congratulate him there was no bride nothing all pure fantasy ah you are wrong i got the clothes before it was the new clothes in fact that made me think of taking you in are you such a good dissembler raskolnikov asked carelessly you wouldn t have supposed it eh wait a bit i shall take you in too ha ha ha no i ll tell you the truth all these questions about crime environment children recall to my mind an article of yours which interested me at the time on crime or something of the sort i forget the title i read it with pleasure two months ago in the periodical review my article in the periodical review raskolnikov asked in astonishment i certainly did write an article upon a book six months ago when i left the university but i sent it to the weekly review but it came out in the periodical and the weekly review ceased to exist so that s why it wasn t printed at the time that s true but when it ceased to exist the weekly review was amalgamated with the periodical and so your article appeared two months ago in the latter didn t you know raskolnikov had not known why you might get some money out of them for the article what a strange person you are you lead such a solitary life that you know nothing of matters that concern you directly it s a fact i assure you bravo rodya i knew nothing about it either cried razumihin i ll run to day to the reading room and ask for the number two months ago what was the date it doesn t matter though i will find it think of not telling us how did you find out that the article was mine it s only signed with an initial i only learnt it by chance the other day through the editor i know him i was very much interested i analysed if i remember the psychology of a criminal before and after the crime yes and you maintained that the perpetration of a crime is always accompanied by illness very very original but it was not that part of your article that interested me so much but an idea at the end of the article which i regret to say you merely suggested without working it out clearly there is if you recollect a suggestion that there are certain persons who can that is not precisely are able to but have a perfect right to commit breaches of morality and crimes and that the law is not for them raskolnikov smiled at the exaggerated and intentional distortion of his idea what what do you mean a right to crime but not because of the influence of environment razumihin inquired with some alarm even no not exactly because of it answered porfiry in his article all men are divided into ordinary and extraordinary ordinary men have to live in submission have no right to transgress the law because don t you see they are ordinary but extraordinary men have a right to commit any crime and to transgress the law in any way just because they are extraordinary that was your idea if i am not mistaken what do you mean that can t be right razumihin muttered in bewilderment raskolnikov smiled again he saw the point at once and knew where they wanted to drive him he decided to take up the challenge that wasn t quite my contention he began simply and modestly yet i admit that you have stated it almost correctly perhaps if you like perfectly so it almost gave him pleasure to admit this the only difference is that i don t contend that extraordinary people are always bound to commit breaches of morals as you call it in fact i doubt whether such an argument could be published i simply hinted that an extraordinary man has the right that is not an official right but an inner right to decide in his own conscience to overstep certain obstacles and only in case it is essential for the practical fulfilment of his idea sometimes perhaps of benefit to the whole of humanity you say that my article isn t definite i am ready to make it as clear as i can perhaps i am right in thinking you want me to very well i maintain that if the discoveries of kepler and newton could not have been made known except by sacrificing the lives of one a dozen a hundred or more men newton would have had the right would indeed have been in duty bound to eliminate the dozen or the hundred men for the sake of making his discoveries known to the whole of humanity but it does not follow from that that newton had a right to murder people right and left and to steal every day in the market then i remember i maintain in my article that all well legislators and leaders of men such as lycurgus solon mahomet napoleon and so on were all without exception criminals from the very fact that making a new law they transgressed the ancient one handed down from their ancestors and held sacred by the people and they did not stop short at bloodshed either if that bloodshed often of innocent persons fighting bravely in defence of ancient law were of use to their cause it s remarkable in fact that the majority indeed of these benefactors and leaders of humanity were guilty of terrible carnage in short i maintain that all great men or even men a little out of the common that is to say capable of giving some new word must from their very nature be criminals more or less of course otherwise it s hard for them to get out of the common rut and to remain in the common rut is what they can t submit to from their very nature again and to my mind they ought not indeed to submit to it you see that there is nothing particularly new in all that the same thing has been printed and read a thousand times before as for my division of people into ordinary and extraordinary i acknowledge that it s somewhat arbitrary but i don t insist upon exact numbers i only believe in my leading idea that men are in general divided by a law of nature into two categories inferior ordinary that is so to say material that serves only to reproduce its kind and men who have the gift or the talent to utter a new word there are of course innumerable sub divisions but the distinguishing features of both categories are fairly well marked the first category generally speaking are men conservative in temperament and law abiding they live under control and love to be controlled to my thinking it is their duty to be controlled because that s their vocation and there is nothing humiliating in it for them the second category all transgress the law they are destroyers or disposed to destruction according to their capacities the crimes of these men are of course relative and varied for the most part they seek in very varied ways the destruction of the present for the sake of the better but if such a one is forced for the sake of his idea to step over a corpse or wade through blood he can i maintain find within himself in his conscience a sanction for wading through blood that depends on the idea and its dimensions note that it s only in that sense i speak of their right to crime in my article you remember it began with the legal question there s no need for such anxiety however the masses will scarcely ever admit this right they punish them or hang them more or less and in doing so fulfil quite justly their conservative vocation but the same masses set these criminals on a pedestal in the next generation and worship them more or less the first category is always the man of the present the second the man of the future the first preserve the world and people it the second move the world and lead it to its goal each class has an equal right to exist in fact all have equal rights with me and vive la guerre eternelle till the new jerusalem of course then you believe in the new jerusalem do you i do raskolnikov answered firmly as he said these words and during the whole preceding tirade he kept his eyes on one spot on the carpet and and do you believe in god excuse my curiosity i do repeated raskolnikov raising his eyes to porfiry and do you believe in lazarus rising from the dead i i do why do you ask all this you believe it literally literally you don t say so i asked from curiosity excuse me but let us go back to the question they are not always executed some on the contrary triumph in their lifetime oh yes some attain their ends in this life and then they begin executing other people if it s necessary indeed for the most part they do your remark is very witty thank you but tell me this how do you distinguish those extraordinary people from the ordinary ones are there signs at their birth i feel there ought to be more exactitude more external definition excuse the natural anxiety of a practical law abiding citizen but couldn t they adopt a special uniform for instance couldn t they wear something be branded in some way for you know if confusion arises and a member of one category imagines that he belongs to the other begins to eliminate obstacles as you so happily expressed it then oh that very often happens that remark is wittier than the other thank you no reason to but take note that the mistake can only arise in the first category that is among the ordinary people as i perhaps unfortunately called them in spite of their predisposition to obedience very many of them through a playfulness of nature sometimes vouchsafed even to the cow like to imagine themselves advanced people destroyers and to push themselves into the new movement and this quite sincerely meanwhile the really new people are very often unobserved by them or even despised as reactionaries of grovelling tendencies but i don t think there is any considerable danger here and you really need not be uneasy for they never go very far of course they might have a thrashing sometimes for letting their fancy run away with them and to teach them their place but no more in fact even this isn t necessary as they castigate themselves for they are very conscientious some perform this service for one another and others chastise themselves with their own hands they will impose various public acts of penitence upon themselves with a beautiful and edifying effect in fact you ve nothing to be uneasy about it s a law of nature well you have certainly set my mind more at rest on that score but there s another thing worries me tell me please are there many people who have the right to kill others these extraordinary people i am ready to bow down to them of course but you must admit it s alarming if there are a great many of them eh oh you needn t worry about that either raskolnikov went on in the same tone people with new ideas people with the faintest capacity for saying something new are extremely few in number extraordinarily so in fact one thing only is clear that the appearance of all these grades and sub divisions of men must follow with unfailing regularity some law of nature that law of course is unknown at present but i am convinced that it exists and one day may become known the vast mass of mankind is mere material and only exists in order by some great effort by some mysterious process by means of some crossing of races and stocks to bring into the world at last perhaps one man out of a thousand with a spark of independence one in ten thousand perhaps i speak roughly approximately is born with some independence and with still greater independence one in a hundred thousand the man of genius is one of millions and the great geniuses the crown of humanity appear on earth perhaps one in many thousand millions in fact i have not peeped into the retort in which all this takes place but there certainly is and must be a definite law it cannot be a matter of chance why are you both joking razumihin cried at last there you sit making fun of one another are you serious rodya raskolnikov raised his pale and almost mournful face and made no reply and the unconcealed persistent nervous and discourteous sarcasm of porfiry seemed strange to razumihin beside that quiet and mournful face well brother if you are really serious you are right of course in saying that it s not new that it s like what we ve read and heard a thousand times already but what is really original in all this and is exclusively your own to my horror is that you sanction bloodshed in the name of conscience and excuse my saying so with such fanaticism that i take it is the point of your article but that sanction of bloodshed by conscience is to my mind more terrible than the official legal sanction of bloodshed you are quite right it is more terrible porfiry agreed yes you must have exaggerated there is some mistake i shall read it you can t think that i shall read it all that is not in the article there s only a hint of it said raskolnikov yes yes porfiry couldn t sit still your attitude to crime is pretty clear to me now but excuse me for my impertinence i am really ashamed to be worrying you like this you see you ve removed my anxiety as to the two grades getting mixed but there are various practical possibilities that make me uneasy what if some man or youth imagines that he is a lycurgus or mahomet a future one of course and suppose he begins to remove all obstacles he has some great enterprise before him and needs money for it and tries to get it do you see zametov gave a sudden guffaw in his corner raskolnikov did not even raise his eyes to him i must admit he went on calmly that such cases certainly must arise the vain and foolish are particularly apt to fall into that snare young people especially yes you see well then what then raskolnikov smiled in reply that s not my fault so it is and so it always will be he said just now he nodded at razumihin that i sanction bloodshed society is too well protected by prisons banishment criminal investigators penal servitude there s no need to be uneasy you have but to catch the thief and what if we do catch him then he gets what he deserves you are certainly logical but what of his conscience why do you care about that simply from humanity if he has a conscience he will suffer for his mistake that will be his punishment as well as the prison but the real geniuses asked razumihin frowning those who have the right to murder oughtn t they to suffer at all even for the blood they ve shed why the word ought it s not a matter of permission or prohibition he will suffer if he is sorry for his victim pain and suffering are always inevitable for a large intelligence and a deep heart the really great men must i think have great sadness on earth he added dreamily not in the tone of the conversation he raised his eyes looked earnestly at them all smiled and took his cap he was too quiet by comparison with his manner at his entrance and he felt this everyone got up well you may abuse me be angry with me if you like porfiry petrovitch began again but i can t resist allow me one little question i know i am troubling you there is just one little notion i want to express simply that i may not forget it very good tell me your little notion raskolnikov stood waiting pale and grave before him well you see i really don t know how to express it properly it s a playful psychological idea when you were writing your article surely you couldn t have helped he he fancying yourself just a little an extraordinary man uttering a new word in your sense that s so isn t it quite possibly raskolnikov answered contemptuously razumihin made a movement and if so could you bring yourself in case of worldly difficulties and hardship or for some service to humanity to overstep obstacles for instance to rob and murder and again he winked with his left eye and laughed noiselessly just as before if i did i certainly should not tell you raskolnikov answered with defiant and haughty contempt no i was only interested on account of your article from a literary point of view foo how obvious and insolent that is raskolnikov thought with repulsion allow me to observe he answered dryly that i don t consider myself a mahomet or a napoleon nor any personage of that kind and not being one of them i cannot tell you how i should act oh come don t we all think ourselves napoleons now in russia porfiry petrovitch said with alarming familiarity something peculiar betrayed itself in the very intonation of his voice perhaps it was one of these future napoleons who did for alyona ivanovna last week zametov blurted out from the corner raskolnikov did not speak but looked firmly and intently at porfiry razumihin was scowling gloomily he seemed before this to be noticing something he looked angrily around there was a minute of gloomy silence raskolnikov turned to go are you going already porfiry said amiably holding out his hand with excessive politeness very very glad of your acquaintance as for your request have no uneasiness write just as i told you or better still come to me there yourself in a day or two to morrow indeed i shall be there at eleven o clock for certain we ll arrange it all we ll have a talk as one of the last to be there you might perhaps be able to tell us something he added with a most good natured expression you want to cross examine me officially in due form raskolnikov asked sharply oh why that s not necessary for the present you misunderstand me i lose no opportunity you see and i ve talked with all who had pledges i obtained evidence from some of them and you are the last yes by the way he cried seemingly suddenly delighted i just remember what was i thinking of he turned to razumihin you were talking my ears off about that nikolay of course i know i know very well he turned to raskolnikov that the fellow is innocent but what is one to do we had to trouble dmitri too this is the point this is all when you went up the stairs it was past seven wasn t it yes answered raskolnikov with an unpleasant sensation at the very moment he spoke that he need not have said it then when you went upstairs between seven and eight didn t you see in a flat that stood open on a second storey do you remember two workmen or at least one of them they were painting there didn t you notice them it s very very important for them painters no i didn t see them raskolnikov answered slowly as though ransacking his memory while at the same instant he was racking every nerve almost swooning with anxiety to conjecture as quickly as possible where the trap lay and not to overlook anything no i didn t see them and i don t think i noticed a flat like that open but on the fourth storey he had mastered the trap now and was triumphant i remember now that someone was moving out of the flat opposite alyona ivanovna s i remember i remember it clearly some porters were carrying out a sofa and they squeezed me against the wall but painters no i don t remember that there were any painters and i don t think that there was a flat open anywhere no there wasn t what do you mean razumihin shouted suddenly as though he had reflected and realised why it was on the day of the murder the painters were at work and he was there three days before what are you asking foo i have muddled it porfiry slapped himself on the forehead deuce take it this business is turning my brain he addressed raskolnikov somewhat apologetically it would be such a great thing for us to find out whether anyone had seen them between seven and eight at the flat so i fancied you could perhaps have told us something i quite muddled it then you should be more careful razumihin observed grimly the last words were uttered in the passage porfiry petrovitch saw them to the door with excessive politeness they went out into the street gloomy and sullen and for some steps they did not say a word raskolnikov drew a deep breath chapter vi i don t believe it i can t believe it repeated razumihin trying in perplexity to refute raskolnikov s arguments they were by now approaching bakaleyev s lodgings where pulcheria alexandrovna and dounia had been expecting them a long while razumihin kept stopping on the way in the heat of discussion confused and excited by the very fact that they were for the first time speaking openly about it don t believe it then answered raskolnikov with a cold careless smile you were noticing nothing as usual but i was weighing every word you are suspicious that is why you weighed their words h m certainly i agree porfiry s tone was rather strange and still more that wretch zametov you are right there was something about him but why why he has changed his mind since last night quite the contrary if they had that brainless idea they would do their utmost to hide it and conceal their cards so as to catch you afterwards but it was all impudent and careless if they had had facts i mean real facts or at least grounds for suspicion then they would certainly have tried to hide their game in the hope of getting more they would have made a search long ago besides but they have no facts not one it is all mirage all ambiguous simply a floating idea so they try to throw me out by impudence and perhaps he was irritated at having no facts and blurted it out in his vexation or perhaps he has some plan he seems an intelligent man perhaps he wanted to frighten me by pretending to know they have a psychology of their own brother but it is loathsome explaining it all stop and it s insulting insulting i understand you but since we have spoken openly now and it is an excellent thing that we have at last i am glad i will own now frankly that i noticed it in them long ago this idea of course the merest hint only an insinuation but why an insinuation even how dare they what foundation have they if only you knew how furious i have been think only simply because a poor student unhinged by poverty and hypochondria on the eve of a severe delirious illness note that suspicious vain proud who has not seen a soul to speak to for six months in rags and in boots without soles has to face some wretched policemen and put up with their insolence and the unexpected debt thrust under his nose the i o u presented by tchebarov the new paint thirty degrees reaumur and a stifling atmosphere a crowd of people the talk about the murder of a person where he had been just before and all that on an empty stomach he might well have a fainting fit and that that is what they found it all on damn them i understand how annoying it is but in your place rodya i would laugh at them or better still spit in their ugly faces and spit a dozen times in all directions i d hit out in all directions neatly too and so i d put an end to it damn them don t be downhearted it s a shame he really has put it well though raskolnikov thought damn them but the cross examination again to morrow he said with bitterness must i really enter into explanations with them i feel vexed as it is that i condescended to speak to zametov yesterday in the restaurant damn it i will go myself to porfiry i will squeeze it out of him as one of the family he must let me know the ins and outs of it all and as for zametov at last he sees through him thought raskolnikov stay cried razumihin seizing him by the shoulder again stay you were wrong i have thought it out you are wrong how was that a trap you say that the question about the workmen was a trap but if you had done that could you have said you had seen them painting the flat and the workmen on the contrary you would have seen nothing even if you had seen it who would own it against himself if i had done that thing i should certainly have said that i had seen the workmen and the flat raskolnikov answered with reluctance and obvious disgust but why speak against yourself because only peasants or the most inexperienced novices deny everything flatly at examinations if a man is ever so little developed and experienced he will certainly try to admit all the external facts that can t be avoided but will seek other explanations of them will introduce some special unexpected turn that will give them another significance and put them in another light porfiry might well reckon that i should be sure to answer so and say i had seen them to give an air of truth and then make some explanation but he would have told you at once that the workmen could not have been there two days before and that therefore you must have been there on the day of the murder at eight o clock and so he would have caught you over a detail yes that is what he was reckoning on that i should not have time to reflect and should be in a hurry to make the most likely answer and so would forget that the workmen could not have been there two days before but how could you forget it nothing easier it is in just such stupid things clever people are most easily caught the more cunning a man is the less he suspects that he will be caught in a simple thing the more cunning a man is the simpler the trap he must be caught in porfiry is not such a fool as you think he is a knave then if that is so raskolnikov could not help laughing but at the very moment he was struck by the strangeness of his own frankness and the eagerness with which he had made this explanation though he had kept up all the preceding conversation with gloomy repulsion obviously with a motive from necessity i am getting a relish for certain aspects he thought to himself but almost at the same instant he became suddenly uneasy as though an unexpected and alarming idea had occurred to him his uneasiness kept on increasing they had just reached the entrance to bakaleyev s go in alone said raskolnikov suddenly i will be back directly where are you going why we are just here i can t help it i will come in half an hour tell them say what you like i will come with you you too want to torture me he screamed with such bitter irritation such despair in his eyes that razumihin s hands dropped he stood for some time on the steps looking gloomily at raskolnikov striding rapidly away in the direction of his lodging at last gritting his teeth and clenching his fist he swore he would squeeze porfiry like a lemon that very day and went up the stairs to reassure pulcheria alexandrovna who was by now alarmed at their long absence when raskolnikov got home his hair was soaked with sweat and he was breathing heavily he went rapidly up the stairs walked into his unlocked room and at once fastened the latch then in senseless terror he rushed to the corner to that hole under the paper where he had put the things put his hand in and for some minutes felt carefully in the hole in every crack and fold of the paper finding nothing he got up and drew a deep breath as he was reaching the steps of bakaleyev s he suddenly fancied that something a chain a stud or even a bit of paper in which they had been wrapped with the old woman s handwriting on it might somehow have slipped out and been lost in some crack and then might suddenly turn up as unexpected conclusive evidence against him he stood as though lost in thought and a strange humiliated half senseless smile strayed on his lips he took his cap at last and went quietly out of the room his ideas were all tangled he went dreamily through the gateway here he is himself shouted a loud voice he raised his head the porter was standing at the door of his little room and was pointing him out to a short man who looked like an artisan wearing a long coat and a waistcoat and looking at a distance remarkably like a woman he stooped and his head in a greasy cap hung forward from his wrinkled flabby face he looked over fifty his little eyes were lost in fat and they looked out grimly sternly and discontentedly what is it raskolnikov asked going up to the porter the man stole a look at him from under his brows and he looked at him attentively deliberately then he turned slowly and went out of the gate into the street without saying a word what is it cried raskolnikov why he there was asking whether a student lived here mentioned your name and whom you lodged with i saw you coming and pointed you out and he went away it s funny the porter too seemed rather puzzled but not much so and after wondering for a moment he turned and went back to his room raskolnikov ran after the stranger and at once caught sight of him walking along the other side of the street with the same even deliberate step with his eyes fixed on the ground as though in meditation he soon overtook him but for some time walked behind him at last moving on to a level with him he looked at his face the man noticed him at once looked at him quickly but dropped his eyes again and so they walked for a minute side by side without uttering a word you were inquiring for me of the porter raskolnikov said at last but in a curiously quiet voice the man made no answer he didn t even look at him again they were both silent why do you come and ask for me and say nothing what s the meaning of it raskolnikov s voice broke and he seemed unable to articulate the words clearly the man raised his eyes this time and turned a gloomy sinister look at raskolnikov murderer he said suddenly in a quiet but clear and distinct voice raskolnikov went on walking beside him his legs felt suddenly weak a cold shiver ran down his spine and his heart seemed to stand still for a moment then suddenly began throbbing as though it were set free so they walked for about a hundred paces side by side in silence the man did not look at him what do you mean what is who is a murderer muttered raskolnikov hardly audibly you are a murderer the man answered still more articulately and emphatically with a smile of triumphant hatred and again he looked straight into raskolnikov s pale face and stricken eyes they had just reached the cross roads the man turned to the left without looking behind him raskolnikov remained standing gazing after him he saw him turn round fifty paces away and look back at him still standing there raskolnikov could not see clearly but he fancied that he was again smiling the same smile of cold hatred and triumph with slow faltering steps with shaking knees raskolnikov made his way back to his little garret feeling chilled all over he took off his cap and put it on the table and for ten minutes he stood without moving then he sank exhausted on the sofa and with a weak moan of pain he stretched himself on it so he lay for half an hour he thought of nothing some thoughts or fragments of thoughts some images without order or coherence floated before his mind faces of people he had seen in his childhood or met somewhere once whom he would never have recalled the belfry of the church at v the billiard table in a restaurant and some officers playing billiards the smell of cigars in some underground tobacco shop a tavern room a back staircase quite dark all sloppy with dirty water and strewn with egg shells and the sunday bells floating in from somewhere the images followed one another whirling like a hurricane some of them he liked and tried to clutch at but they faded and all the while there was an oppression within him but it was not overwhelming sometimes it was even pleasant the slight shivering still persisted but that too was an almost pleasant sensation he heard the hurried footsteps of razumihin he closed his eyes and pretended to be asleep razumihin opened the door and stood for some time in the doorway as though hesitating then he stepped softly into the room and went cautiously to the sofa raskolnikov heard nastasya s whisper don t disturb him let him sleep he can have his dinner later quite so answered razumihin both withdrew carefully and closed the door another half hour passed raskolnikov opened his eyes turned on his back again clasping his hands behind his head who is he who is that man who sprang out of the earth where was he what did he see he has seen it all that s clear where was he then and from where did he see why has he only now sprung out of the earth and how could he see is it possible hm continued raskolnikov turning cold and shivering and the jewel case nikolay found behind the door was that possible a clue you miss an infinitesimal line and you can build it into a pyramid of evidence a fly flew by and saw it is it possible he felt with sudden loathing how weak how physically weak he had become i ought to have known it he thought with a bitter smile and how dared i knowing myself knowing how i should be take up an axe and shed blood i ought to have known beforehand ah but i did know he whispered in despair at times he came to a standstill at some thought no those men are not made so the real master to whom all is permitted storms toulon makes a massacre in paris forgets an army in egypt wastes half a million men in the moscow expedition and gets off with a jest at vilna and altars are set up to him after his death and so all is permitted no such people it seems are not of flesh but of bronze one sudden irrelevant idea almost made him laugh napoleon the pyramids waterloo and a wretched skinny old woman a pawnbroker with a red trunk under her bed it s a nice hash for porfiry petrovitch to digest how can they digest it it s too inartistic a napoleon creep under an old woman s bed ugh how loathsome at moments he felt he was raving he sank into a state of feverish excitement the old woman is of no consequence he thought hotly and incoherently the old woman was a mistake perhaps but she is not what matters the old woman was only an illness i was in a hurry to overstep i didn t kill a human being but a principle i killed the principle but i didn t overstep i stopped on this side i was only capable of killing and it seems i wasn t even capable of that principle why was that fool razumihin abusing the socialists they are industrious commercial people the happiness of all is their case no life is only given to me once and i shall never have it again i don t want to wait for the happiness of all i want to live myself or else better not live at all i simply couldn t pass by my mother starving keeping my rouble in my pocket while i waited for the happiness of all i am putting my little brick into the happiness of all and so my heart is at peace ha ha why have you let me slip i only live once i too want ech i am an aesthetic louse and nothing more he added suddenly laughing like a madman yes i am certainly a louse he went on clutching at the idea gloating over it and playing with it with vindictive pleasure in the first place because i can reason that i am one and secondly because for a month past i have been troubling benevolent providence calling it to witness that not for my own fleshly lusts did i undertake it but with a grand and noble object ha ha thirdly because i aimed at carrying it out as justly as possible weighing measuring and calculating of all the lice i picked out the most useless one and proposed to take from her only as much as i needed for the first step no more nor less so the rest would have gone to a monastery according to her will ha ha and what shows that i am utterly a louse he added grinding his teeth is that i am perhaps viler and more loathsome than the louse i killed and i felt beforehand that i should tell myself so after killing her can anything be compared with the horror of that the vulgarity the abjectness i understand the prophet with his sabre on his steed allah commands and trembling creation must obey the prophet is right he is right when he sets a battery across the street and blows up the innocent and the guilty without deigning to explain it s for you to obey trembling creation and not to have desires for that s not for you i shall never never forgive the old woman his hair was soaked with sweat his quivering lips were parched his eyes were fixed on the ceiling mother sister how i loved them why do i hate them now yes i hate them i feel a physical hatred for them i can t bear them near me i went up to my mother and kissed her i remember to embrace her and think if she only knew shall i tell her then that s just what i might do she must be the same as i am he added straining himself to think as it were struggling with delirium ah how i hate the old woman now i feel i should kill her again if she came to life poor lizaveta why did she come in it s strange though why is it i scarcely ever think of her as though i hadn t killed her lizaveta sonia poor gentle things with gentle eyes dear women why don t they weep why don t they moan they give up everything their eyes are soft and gentle sonia sonia gentle sonia he lost consciousness it seemed strange to him that he didn t remember how he got into the street it was late evening the twilight had fallen and the full moon was shining more and more brightly but there was a peculiar breathlessness in the air there were crowds of people in the street workmen and business people were making their way home other people had come out for a walk there was a smell of mortar dust and stagnant water raskolnikov walked along mournful and anxious he was distinctly aware of having come out with a purpose of having to do something in a hurry but what it was he had forgotten suddenly he stood still and saw a man standing on the other side of the street beckoning to him he crossed over to him but at once the man turned and walked away with his head hanging as though he had made no sign to him stay did he really beckon raskolnikov wondered but he tried to overtake him when he was within ten paces he recognised him and was frightened it was the same man with stooping shoulders in the long coat raskolnikov followed him at a distance his heart was beating they went down a turning the man still did not look round does he know i am following him thought raskolnikov the man went into the gateway of a big house raskolnikov hastened to the gate and looked in to see whether he would look round and sign to him in the court yard the man did turn round and again seemed to beckon him raskolnikov at once followed him into the yard but the man was gone he must have gone up the first staircase raskolnikov rushed after him he heard slow measured steps two flights above the staircase seemed strangely familiar he reached the window on the first floor the moon shone through the panes with a melancholy and mysterious light then he reached the second floor bah this is the flat where the painters were at work but how was it he did not recognise it at once the steps of the man above had died away so he must have stopped or hidden somewhere he reached the third storey should he go on there was a stillness that was dreadful but he went on the sound of his own footsteps scared and frightened him how dark it was the man must be hiding in some corner here ah the flat was standing wide open he hesitated and went in it was very dark and empty in the passage as though everything had been removed he crept on tiptoe into the parlour which was flooded with moonlight everything there was as before the chairs the looking glass the yellow sofa and the pictures in the frames a huge round copper red moon looked in at the windows it s the moon that makes it so still weaving some mystery thought raskolnikov he stood and waited waited a long while and the more silent the moonlight the more violently his heart beat till it was painful and still the same hush suddenly he heard a momentary sharp crack like the snapping of a splinter and all was still again a fly flew up suddenly and struck the window pane with a plaintive buzz at that moment he noticed in the corner between the window and the little cupboard something like a cloak hanging on the wall why is that cloak here he thought it wasn t there before he went up to it quietly and felt that there was someone hiding behind it he cautiously moved the cloak and saw sitting on a chair in the corner the old woman bent double so that he couldn t see her face but it was she he stood over her she is afraid he thought he stealthily took the axe from the noose and struck her one blow then another on the skull but strange to say she did not stir as though she were made of wood he was frightened bent down nearer and tried to look at her but she too bent her head lower he bent right down to the ground and peeped up into her face from below he peeped and turned cold with horror the old woman was sitting and laughing shaking with noiseless laughter doing her utmost that he should not hear it suddenly he fancied that the door from the bedroom was opened a little and that there was laughter and whispering within he was overcome with frenzy and he began hitting the old woman on the head with all his force but at every blow of the axe the laughter and whispering from the bedroom grew louder and the old woman was simply shaking with mirth he was rushing away but the passage was full of people the doors of the flats stood open and on the landing on the stairs and everywhere below there were people rows of heads all looking but huddled together in silence and expectation something gripped his heart his legs were rooted to the spot they would not move he tried to scream and woke up he drew a deep breath but his dream seemed strangely to persist his door was flung open and a man whom he had never seen stood in the doorway watching him intently raskolnikov had hardly opened his eyes and he instantly closed them again he lay on his back without stirring is it still a dream he wondered and again raised his eyelids hardly perceptibly the stranger was standing in the same place still watching him he stepped cautiously into the room carefully closing the door after him went up to the table paused a moment still keeping his eyes on raskolnikov and noiselessly seated himself on the chair by the sofa he put his hat on the floor beside him and leaned his hands on his cane and his chin on his hands it was evident that he was prepared to wait indefinitely as far as raskolnikov could make out from his stolen glances he was a man no longer young stout with a full fair almost whitish beard ten minutes passed it was still light but beginning to get dusk there was complete stillness in the room not a sound came from the stairs only a big fly buzzed and fluttered against the window pane it was unbearable at last raskolnikov suddenly got up and sat on the sofa come tell me what you want i knew you were not asleep but only pretending the stranger answered oddly laughing calmly arkady ivanovitch svidrigailov allow me to introduce myself part iv chapter i can this be still a dream raskolnikov thought once more he looked carefully and suspiciously at the unexpected visitor svidrigailov what nonsense it can t be he said at last aloud in bewilderment his visitor did not seem at all surprised at this exclamation i ve come to you for two reasons in the first place i wanted to make your personal acquaintance as i have already heard a great deal about you that is interesting and flattering secondly i cherish the hope that you may not refuse to assist me in a matter directly concerning the welfare of your sister avdotya romanovna for without your support she might not let me come near her now for she is prejudiced against me but with your assistance i reckon on you reckon wrongly interrupted raskolnikov they only arrived yesterday may i ask you raskolnikov made no reply it was yesterday i know i only arrived myself the day before well let me tell you this rodion romanovitch i don t consider it necessary to justify myself but kindly tell me what was there particularly criminal on my part in all this business speaking without prejudice with common sense raskolnikov continued to look at him in silence that in my own house i persecuted a defenceless girl and insulted her with my infamous proposals is that it i am anticipating you but you ve only to assume that i too am a man et nihil humanum in a word that i am capable of being attracted and falling in love which does not depend on our will then everything can be explained in the most natural manner the question is am i a monster or am i myself a victim and what if i am a victim in proposing to the object of my passion to elope with me to america or switzerland i may have cherished the deepest respect for her and may have thought that i was promoting our mutual happiness reason is the slave of passion you know why probably i was doing more harm to myself than anyone but that s not the point raskolnikov interrupted with disgust it s simply that whether you are right or wrong we dislike you we don t want to have anything to do with you we show you the door go out svidrigailov broke into a sudden laugh but you re but there s no getting round you he said laughing in the frankest way i hoped to get round you but you took up the right line at once but you are trying to get round me still what of it what of it cried svidrigailov laughing openly but this is what the french call bonne guerre and the most innocent form of deception but still you have interrupted me one way or another i repeat again there would never have been any unpleasantness except for what happened in the garden marfa petrovna you have got rid of marfa petrovna too so they say raskolnikov interrupted rudely oh you ve heard that too then you d be sure to though but as for your question i really don t know what to say though my own conscience is quite at rest on that score don t suppose that i am in any apprehension about it all was regular and in order the medical inquiry diagnosed apoplexy due to bathing immediately after a heavy dinner and a bottle of wine and indeed it could have proved nothing else but i ll tell you what i have been thinking to myself of late on my way here in the train especially didn t i contribute to all that calamity morally in a way by irritation or something of the sort but i came to the conclusion that that too was quite out of the question raskolnikov laughed i wonder you trouble yourself about it but what are you laughing at only consider i struck her just twice with a switch there were no marks even don t regard me as a cynic please i am perfectly aware how atrocious it was of me and all that but i know for certain too that marfa petrovna was very likely pleased at my so to say warmth the story of your sister had been wrung out to the last drop for the last three days marfa petrovna had been forced to sit at home she had nothing to show herself with in the town besides she had bored them so with that letter you heard about her reading the letter and all of a sudden those two switches fell from heaven her first act was to order the carriage to be got out not to speak of the fact that there are cases when women are very very glad to be insulted in spite of all their show of indignation there are instances of it with everyone human beings in general indeed greatly love to be insulted have you noticed that but it s particularly so with women one might even say it s their only amusement at one time raskolnikov thought of getting up and walking out and so finishing the interview but some curiosity and even a sort of prudence made him linger for a moment you are fond of fighting he asked carelessly no not very svidrigailov answered calmly and marfa petrovna and i scarcely ever fought we lived very harmoniously and she was always pleased with me i only used the whip twice in all our seven years not counting a third occasion of a very ambiguous character the first time two months after our marriage immediately after we arrived in the country and the last time was that of which we are speaking did you suppose i was such a monster such a reactionary such a slave driver ha ha by the way do you remember rodion romanovitch how a few years ago in those days of beneficent publicity a nobleman i ve forgotten his name was put to shame everywhere in all the papers for having thrashed a german woman in the railway train you remember it was in those days that very year i believe the disgraceful action of the age took place you know the egyptian nights that public reading you remember the dark eyes you know ah the golden days of our youth where are they well as for the gentleman who thrashed the german i feel no sympathy with him because after all what need is there for sympathy but i must say that there are sometimes such provoking germans that i don t believe there is a progressive who could quite answer for himself no one looked at the subject from that point of view then but that s the truly humane point of view i assure you after saying this svidrigailov broke into a sudden laugh again raskolnikov saw clearly that this was a man with a firm purpose in his mind and able to keep it to himself i expect you ve not talked to anyone for some days he asked scarcely anyone i suppose you are wondering at my being such an adaptable man no i am only wondering at your being too adaptable a man because i am not offended at the rudeness of your questions is that it but why take offence as you asked so i answered he replied with a surprising expression of simplicity you know there s hardly anything i take interest in he went on as it were dreamily especially now i ve nothing to do you are quite at liberty to imagine though that i am making up to you with a motive particularly as i told you i want to see your sister about something but i ll confess frankly i am very much bored the last three days especially so i am delighted to see you don t be angry rodion romanovitch but you seem to be somehow awfully strange yourself say what you like there s something wrong with you and now too not this very minute i mean but now generally well well i won t i won t don t scowl i am not such a bear you know as you think raskolnikov looked gloomily at him you are not a bear perhaps at all he said i fancy indeed that you are a man of very good breeding or at least know how on occasion to behave like one i am not particularly interested in anyone s opinion svidrigailov answered dryly and even with a shade of haughtiness and therefore why not be vulgar at times when vulgarity is such a convenient cloak for our climate and especially if one has a natural propensity that way he added laughing again but i ve heard you have many friends here you are as they say not without connections what can you want with me then unless you ve some special object that s true that i have friends here svidrigailov admitted not replying to the chief point i ve met some already i ve been lounging about for the last three days and i ve seen them or they ve seen me that s a matter of course i am well dressed and reckoned not a poor man the emancipation of the serfs hasn t affected me my property consists chiefly of forests and water meadows the revenue has not fallen off but i am not going to see them i was sick of them long ago i ve been here three days and have called on no one what a town it is how has it come into existence among us tell me that a town of officials and students of all sorts yes there s a great deal i didn t notice when i was here eight years ago kicking up my heels my only hope now is in anatomy by jove it is anatomy but as for these clubs dussauts parades or progress indeed maybe well all that can go on without me he went on again without noticing the question besides who wants to be a card sharper why have you been a card sharper then how could i help being there was a regular set of us men of the best society eight years ago we had a fine time and all men of breeding you know poets men of property and indeed as a rule in our russian society the best manners are found among those who ve been thrashed have you noticed that i ve deteriorated in the country but i did get into prison for debt through a low greek who came from nezhin then marfa petrovna turned up she bargained with him and bought me off for thirty thousand silver pieces i owed seventy thousand we were united in lawful wedlock and she bore me off into the country like a treasure you know she was five years older than i she was very fond of me for seven years i never left the country and take note that all my life she held a document over me the iou for thirty thousand roubles so if i were to elect to be restive about anything i should be trapped at once and she would have done it women find nothing incompatible in that if it hadn t been for that would you have given her the slip i don t know what to say it was scarcely the document restrained me i didn t want to go anywhere else marfa petrovna herself invited me to go abroad seeing i was bored but i ve been abroad before and always felt sick there for no reason but the sunrise the bay of naples the sea you look at them and it makes you sad what s most revolting is that one is really sad no it s better at home here at least one blames others for everything and excuses oneself i should have gone perhaps on an expedition to the north pole because j ai le vin mauvais and hate drinking and there s nothing left but wine i have tried it but i say i ve been told berg is going up in a great balloon next sunday from the yusupov garden and will take up passengers at a fee is it true why would you go up i no oh no muttered svidrigailov really seeming to be deep in thought what does he mean is he in earnest raskolnikov wondered no the document didn t restrain me svidrigailov went on meditatively it was my own doing not leaving the country and nearly a year ago marfa petrovna gave me back the document on my name day and made me a present of a considerable sum of money too she had a fortune you know you see how i trust you arkady ivanovitch that was actually her expression you don t believe she used it but do you know i managed the estate quite decently they know me in the neighbourhood i ordered books too marfa petrovna at first approved but afterwards she was afraid of my over studying you seem to be missing marfa petrovna very much missing her perhaps really perhaps i am and by the way do you believe in ghosts what ghosts why ordinary ghosts do you believe in them perhaps not pour vous plaire i wouldn t say no exactly do you see them then svidrigailov looked at him rather oddly marfa petrovna is pleased to visit me he said twisting his mouth into a strange smile how do you mean she is pleased to visit you she has been three times i saw her first on the very day of the funeral an hour after she was buried it was the day before i left to come here the second time was the day before yesterday at daybreak on the journey at the station of malaya vishera and the third time was two hours ago in the room where i am staying i was alone were you awake quite awake i was wide awake every time she comes speaks to me for a minute and goes out at the door always at the door i can almost hear her what made me think that something of the sort must be happening to you raskolnikov said suddenly at the same moment he was surprised at having said it he was much excited what did you think so svidrigailov asked in astonishment did you really didn t i say that there was something in common between us eh you never said so raskolnikov cried sharply and with heat didn t i no i thought i did when i came in and saw you lying with your eyes shut pretending i said to myself at once here s the man what do you mean by the man what are you talking about cried raskolnikov what do i mean i really don t know svidrigailov muttered ingenuously as though he too were puzzled for a minute they were silent they stared in each other s faces that s all nonsense raskolnikov shouted with vexation what does she say when she comes to you she would you believe it she talks of the silliest trifles and man is a strange creature it makes me angry the first time she came in i was tired you know the funeral service the funeral ceremony the lunch afterwards at last i was left alone in my study i lighted a cigar and began to think she came in at the door you ve been so busy to day arkady ivanovitch you have forgotten to wind the dining room clock she said all those seven years i ve wound that clock every week and if i forgot it she would always remind me the next day i set off on my way here i got out at the station at daybreak i d been asleep tired out with my eyes half open i was drinking some coffee i looked up and there was suddenly marfa petrovna sitting beside me with a pack of cards in her hands shall i tell your fortune for the journey arkady ivanovitch she was a great hand at telling fortunes i shall never forgive myself for not asking her to i ran away in a fright and besides the bell rang i was sitting to day feeling very heavy after a miserable dinner from a cookshop i was sitting smoking all of a sudden marfa petrovna again she came in very smart in a new green silk dress with a long train good day arkady ivanovitch how do you like my dress aniska can t make like this aniska was a dressmaker in the country one of our former serf girls who had been trained in moscow a pretty wench she stood turning round before me i looked at the dress and then i looked carefully very carefully at her face i wonder you trouble to come to me about such trifles marfa petrovna good gracious you won t let one disturb you about anything to tease her i said i want to get married marfa petrovna that s just like you arkady ivanovitch it does you very little credit to come looking for a bride when you ve hardly buried your wife and if you could make a good choice at least but i know it won t be for your happiness or hers you will only be a laughing stock to all good people then she went out and her train seemed to rustle isn t it nonsense eh but perhaps you are telling lies raskolnikov put in i rarely lie answered svidrigailov thoughtfully apparently not noticing the rudeness of the question and in the past have you ever seen ghosts before y yes i have seen them but only once in my life six years ago i had a serf filka just after his burial i called out forgetting filka my pipe he came in and went to the cupboard where my pipes were i sat still and thought he is doing it out of revenge because we had a violent quarrel just before his death how dare you come in with a hole in your elbow i said go away you scamp he turned and went out and never came again i didn t tell marfa petrovna at the time i wanted to have a service sung for him but i was ashamed you should go to a doctor i know i am not well without your telling me though i don t know what s wrong i believe i am five times as strong as you are i didn t ask you whether you believe that ghosts are seen but whether you believe that they exist no i won t believe it raskolnikov cried with positive anger what do people generally say muttered svidrigailov as though speaking to himself looking aside and bowing his head they say you are ill so what appears to you is only unreal fantasy but that s not strictly logical i agree that ghosts only appear to the sick but that only proves that they are unable to appear except to the sick not that they don t exist nothing of the sort raskolnikov insisted irritably no you don t think so svidrigailov went on looking at him deliberately but what do you say to this argument help me with it ghosts are as it were shreds and fragments of other worlds the beginning of them a man in health has of course no reason to see them because he is above all a man of this earth and is bound for the sake of completeness and order to live only in this life but as soon as one is ill as soon as the normal earthly order of the organism is broken one begins to realise the possibility of another world and the more seriously ill one is the closer becomes one s contact with that other world so that as soon as the man dies he steps straight into that world i thought of that long ago if you believe in a future life you could believe in that too i don t believe in a future life said raskolnikov svidrigailov sat lost in thought and what if there are only spiders there or something of that sort he said suddenly he is a madman thought raskolnikov we always imagine eternity as something beyond our conception something vast vast but why must it be vast instead of all that what if it s one little room like a bath house in the country black and grimy and spiders in every corner and that s all eternity is i sometimes fancy it like that can it be you can imagine nothing juster and more comforting than that raskolnikov cried with a feeling of anguish juster and how can we tell perhaps that is just and do you know it s what i would certainly have made it answered svidrigailov with a vague smile this horrible answer sent a cold chill through raskolnikov svidrigailov raised his head looked at him and suddenly began laughing only think he cried half an hour ago we had never seen each other we regarded each other as enemies there is a matter unsettled between us we ve thrown it aside and away we ve gone into the abstract wasn t i right in saying that we were birds of a feather kindly allow me raskolnikov went on irritably to ask you to explain why you have honoured me with your visit and and i am in a hurry i have no time to waste i want to go out by all means by all means your sister avdotya romanovna is going to be married to mr luzhin pyotr petrovitch can you refrain from any question about my sister and from mentioning her name i can t understand how you dare utter her name in my presence if you really are svidrigailov why but i ve come here to speak about her how can i avoid mentioning her very good speak but make haste i am sure that you must have formed your own opinion of this mr luzhin who is a connection of mine through my wife if you have only seen him for half an hour or heard any facts about him he is no match for avdotya romanovna i believe avdotya romanovna is sacrificing herself generously and imprudently for the sake of for the sake of her family i fancied from all i had heard of you that you would be very glad if the match could be broken off without the sacrifice of worldly advantages now i know you personally i am convinced of it all this is very naive excuse me i should have said impudent on your part said raskolnikov you mean to say that i am seeking my own ends don t be uneasy rodion romanovitch if i were working for my own advantage i would not have spoken out so directly i am not quite a fool i will confess something psychologically curious about that just now defending my love for avdotya romanovna i said i was myself the victim well let me tell you that i ve no feeling of love now not the slightest so that i wonder myself indeed for i really did feel something through idleness and depravity raskolnikov put in i certainly am idle and depraved but your sister has such qualities that even i could not help being impressed by them but that s all nonsense as i see myself now have you seen that long i began to be aware of it before but was only perfectly sure of it the day before yesterday almost at the moment i arrived in petersburg i still fancied in moscow though that i was coming to try to get avdotya romanovna s hand and to cut out mr luzhin excuse me for interrupting you kindly be brief and come to the object of your visit i am in a hurry i want to go out with the greatest pleasure on arriving here and determining on a certain journey i should like to make some necessary preliminary arrangements i left my children with an aunt they are well provided for and they have no need of me personally and a nice father i should make too i have taken nothing but what marfa petrovna gave me a year ago that s enough for me excuse me i am just coming to the point before the journey which may come off i want to settle mr luzhin too it s not that i detest him so much but it was through him i quarrelled with marfa petrovna when i learned that she had dished up this marriage i want now to see avdotya romanovna through your mediation and if you like in your presence to explain to her that in the first place she will never gain anything but harm from mr luzhin then begging her pardon for all past unpleasantness to make her a present of ten thousand roubles and so assist the rupture with mr luzhin a rupture to which i believe she is herself not disinclined if she could see the way to it you are certainly mad cried raskolnikov not so much angered as astonished how dare you talk like that i knew you would scream at me but in the first place though i am not rich this ten thousand roubles is perfectly free i have absolutely no need for it if avdotya romanovna does not accept it i shall waste it in some more foolish way that s the first thing secondly my conscience is perfectly easy i make the offer with no ulterior motive you may not believe it but in the end avdotya romanovna and you will know the point is that i did actually cause your sister whom i greatly respect some trouble and unpleasantness and so sincerely regretting it i want not to compensate not to repay her for the unpleasantness but simply to do something to her advantage to show that i am not after all privileged to do nothing but harm if there were a millionth fraction of self interest in my offer i should not have made it so openly and i should not have offered her ten thousand only when five weeks ago i offered her more besides i may perhaps very soon marry a young lady and that alone ought to prevent suspicion of any design on avdotya romanovna in conclusion let me say that in marrying mr luzhin she is taking money just the same only from another man don t be angry rodion romanovitch think it over coolly and quietly svidrigailov himself was exceedingly cool and quiet as he was saying this i beg you to say no more said raskolnikov in any case this is unpardonable impertinence not in the least then a man may do nothing but harm to his neighbour in this world and is prevented from doing the tiniest bit of good by trivial conventional formalities that s absurd if i died for instance and left that sum to your sister in my will surely she wouldn t refuse it very likely she would oh no indeed however if you refuse it so be it though ten thousand roubles is a capital thing to have on occasion in any case i beg you to repeat what i have said to avdotya romanovna no i won t in that case rodion romanovitch i shall be obliged to try and see her myself and worry her by doing so and if i do tell her will you not try to see her i don t know really what to say i should like very much to see her once more don t hope for it i m sorry but you don t know me perhaps we may become better friends you think we may become friends and why not svidrigailov said smiling he stood up and took his hat i didn t quite intend to disturb you and i came here without reckoning on it though i was very much struck by your face this morning where did you see me this morning raskolnikov asked uneasily i saw you by chance i kept fancying there is something about you like me but don t be uneasy i am not intrusive i used to get on all right with card sharpers and i never bored prince svirbey a great personage who is a distant relation of mine and i could write about raphael s madonna in madam prilukov s album and i never left marfa petrovna s side for seven years and i used to stay the night at viazemsky s house in the hay market in the old days and i may go up in a balloon with berg perhaps oh all right are you starting soon on your travels may i ask what travels why on that journey you spoke of it yourself a journey oh yes i did speak of a journey well that s a wide subject if only you knew what you are asking he added and gave a sudden loud short laugh perhaps i ll get married instead of the journey they re making a match for me here yes how have you had time for that but i am very anxious to see avdotya romanovna once i earnestly beg it well good bye for the present oh yes i have forgotten something tell your sister rodion romanovitch that marfa petrovna remembered her in her will and left her three thousand roubles that s absolutely certain marfa petrovna arranged it a week before her death and it was done in my presence avdotya romanovna will be able to receive the money in two or three weeks are you telling the truth yes tell her well your servant i am staying very near you as he went out svidrigailov ran up against razumihin in the doorway chapter ii it was nearly eight o clock the two young men hurried to bakaleyev s to arrive before luzhin why who was that asked razumihin as soon as they were in the street it was svidrigailov that landowner in whose house my sister was insulted when she was their governess through his persecuting her with his attentions she was turned out by his wife marfa petrovna this marfa petrovna begged dounia s forgiveness afterwards and she s just died suddenly it was of her we were talking this morning i don t know why i m afraid of that man he came here at once after his wife s funeral he is very strange and is determined on doing something we must guard dounia from him that s what i wanted to tell you do you hear guard her what can he do to harm avdotya romanovna thank you rodya for speaking to me like that we will we will guard her where does he live i don t know why didn t you ask what a pity i ll find out though did you see him asked raskolnikov after a pause yes i noticed him i noticed him well you did really see him you saw him clearly raskolnikov insisted yes i remember him perfectly i should know him in a thousand i have a good memory for faces they were silent again hm that s all right muttered raskolnikov do you know i fancied i keep thinking that it may have been an hallucination what do you mean i don t understand you well you all say raskolnikov went on twisting his mouth into a smile that i am mad i thought just now that perhaps i really am mad and have only seen a phantom what do you mean why who can tell perhaps i am really mad and perhaps everything that happened all these days may be only imagination ach rodya you have been upset again but what did he say what did he come for raskolnikov did not answer razumihin thought a minute now let me tell you my story he began i came to you you were asleep then we had dinner and then i went to porfiry s zametov was still with him i tried to begin but it was no use i couldn t speak in the right way they don t seem to understand and can t understand but are not a bit ashamed i drew porfiry to the window and began talking to him but it was still no use he looked away and i looked away at last i shook my fist in his ugly face and told him as a cousin i d brain him he merely looked at me i cursed and came away that was all it was very stupid to zametov i didn t say a word but you see i thought i d made a mess of it but as i went downstairs a brilliant idea struck me why should we trouble of course if you were in any danger or anything but why need you care you needn t care a hang for them we shall have a laugh at them afterwards and if i were in your place i d mystify them more than ever how ashamed they ll be afterwards hang them we can thrash them afterwards but let s laugh at them now to be sure answered raskolnikov but what will you say to morrow he thought to himself strange to say till that moment it had never occurred to him to wonder what razumihin would think when he knew as he thought it raskolnikov looked at him razumihin s account of his visit to porfiry had very little interest for him so much had come and gone since then in the corridor they came upon luzhin he had arrived punctually at eight and was looking for the number so that all three went in together without greeting or looking at one another the young men walked in first while pyotr petrovitch for good manners lingered a little in the passage taking off his coat pulcheria alexandrovna came forward at once to greet him in the doorway dounia was welcoming her brother pyotr petrovitch walked in and quite amiably though with redoubled dignity bowed to the ladies he looked however as though he were a little put out and could not yet recover himself pulcheria alexandrovna who seemed also a little embarrassed hastened to make them all sit down at the round table where a samovar was boiling dounia and luzhin were facing one another on opposite sides of the table razumihin and raskolnikov were facing pulcheria alexandrovna razumihin was next to luzhin and raskolnikov was beside his sister a moment s silence followed pyotr petrovitch deliberately drew out a cambric handkerchief reeking of scent and blew his nose with an air of a benevolent man who felt himself slighted and was firmly resolved to insist on an explanation in the passage the idea had occurred to him to keep on his overcoat and walk away and so give the two ladies a sharp and emphatic lesson and make them feel the gravity of the position but he could not bring himself to do this besides he could not endure uncertainty and he wanted an explanation if his request had been so openly disobeyed there was something behind it and in that case it was better to find it out beforehand it rested with him to punish them and there would always be time for that i trust you had a favourable journey he inquired officially of pulcheria alexandrovna oh very pyotr petrovitch i am gratified to hear it and avdotya romanovna is not over fatigued either i am young and strong i don t get tired but it was a great strain for mother answered dounia that s unavoidable our national railways are of terrible length mother russia as they say is a vast country in spite of all my desire to do so i was unable to meet you yesterday but i trust all passed off without inconvenience oh no pyotr petrovitch it was all terribly disheartening pulcheria alexandrovna hastened to declare with peculiar intonation and if dmitri prokofitch had not been sent us i really believe by god himself we should have been utterly lost here he is dmitri prokofitch razumihin she added introducing him to luzhin i had the pleasure yesterday muttered pyotr petrovitch with a hostile glance sidelong at razumihin then he scowled and was silent pyotr petrovitch belonged to that class of persons on the surface very polite in society who make a great point of punctiliousness but who directly they are crossed in anything are completely disconcerted and become more like sacks of flour than elegant and lively men of society again all was silent raskolnikov was obstinately mute avdotya romanovna was unwilling to open the conversation too soon razumihin had nothing to say so pulcheria alexandrovna was anxious again marfa petrovna is dead have you heard she began having recourse to her leading item of conversation to be sure i heard so i was immediately informed and i have come to make you acquainted with the fact that arkady ivanovitch svidrigailov set off in haste for petersburg immediately after his wife s funeral so at least i have excellent authority for believing to petersburg here dounia asked in alarm and looked at her mother yes indeed and doubtless not without some design having in view the rapidity of his departure and all the circumstances preceding it good heavens won t he leave dounia in peace even here cried pulcheria alexandrovna i imagine that neither you nor avdotya romanovna have any grounds for uneasiness unless of course you are yourselves desirous of getting into communication with him for my part i am on my guard and am now discovering where he is lodging oh pyotr petrovitch you would not believe what a fright you have given me pulcheria alexandrovna went on i ve only seen him twice but i thought him terrible terrible i am convinced that he was the cause of marfa petrovna s death it s impossible to be certain about that i have precise information i do not dispute that he may have contributed to accelerate the course of events by the moral influence so to say of the affront but as to the general conduct and moral characteristics of that personage i am in agreement with you i do not know whether he is well off now and precisely what marfa petrovna left him this will be known to me within a very short period but no doubt here in petersburg if he has any pecuniary resources he will relapse at once into his old ways he is the most depraved and abjectly vicious specimen of that class of men i have considerable reason to believe that marfa petrovna who was so unfortunate as to fall in love with him and to pay his debts eight years ago was of service to him also in another way solely by her exertions and sacrifices a criminal charge involving an element of fantastic and homicidal brutality for which he might well have been sentenced to siberia was hushed up that s the sort of man he is if you care to know good heavens cried pulcheria alexandrovna raskolnikov listened attentively are you speaking the truth when you say that you have good evidence of this dounia asked sternly and emphatically i only repeat what i was told in secret by marfa petrovna i must observe that from the legal point of view the case was far from clear there was and i believe still is living here a woman called resslich a foreigner who lent small sums of money at interest and did other commissions and with this woman svidrigailov had for a long while close and mysterious relations she had a relation a niece i believe living with her a deaf and dumb girl of fifteen or perhaps not more than fourteen resslich hated this girl and grudged her every crust she used to beat her mercilessly one day the girl was found hanging in the garret at the inquest the verdict was suicide after the usual proceedings the matter ended but later on information was given that the child had been cruelly outraged by svidrigailov it is true this was not clearly established the information was given by another german woman of loose character whose word could not be trusted no statement was actually made to the police thanks to marfa petrovna s money and exertions it did not get beyond gossip and yet the story is a very significant one you heard no doubt avdotya romanovna when you were with them the story of the servant philip who died of ill treatment he received six years ago before the abolition of serfdom i heard on the contrary that this philip hanged himself quite so but what drove him or rather perhaps disposed him to suicide was the systematic persecution and severity of mr svidrigailov i don t know that answered dounia dryly i only heard a queer story that philip was a sort of hypochondriac a sort of domestic philosopher the servants used to say he read himself silly and that he hanged himself partly on account of mr svidrigailov s mockery of him and not his blows when i was there he behaved well to the servants and they were actually fond of him though they certainly did blame him for philip s death i perceive avdotya romanovna that you seem disposed to undertake his defence all of a sudden luzhin observed twisting his lips into an ambiguous smile there s no doubt that he is an astute man and insinuating where ladies are concerned of which marfa petrovna who has died so strangely is a terrible instance my only desire has been to be of service to you and your mother with my advice in view of the renewed efforts which may certainly be anticipated from him for my part it s my firm conviction that he will end in a debtor s prison again marfa petrovna had not the slightest intention of settling anything substantial on him having regard for his children s interests and if she left him anything it would only be the merest sufficiency something insignificant and ephemeral which would not last a year for a man of his habits pyotr petrovitch i beg you said dounia say no more of mr svidrigailov it makes me miserable he has just been to see me said raskolnikov breaking his silence for the first time there were exclamations from all and they all turned to him even pyotr petrovitch was roused an hour and a half ago he came in when i was asleep waked me and introduced himself raskolnikov continued he was fairly cheerful and at ease and quite hopes that we shall become friends he is particularly anxious by the way dounia for an interview with you at which he asked me to assist he has a proposition to make to you and he told me about it he told me too that a week before her death marfa petrovna left you three thousand roubles in her will dounia and that you can receive the money very shortly thank god cried pulcheria alexandrovna crossing herself pray for her soul dounia it s a fact broke from luzhin tell us what more dounia urged raskolnikov then he said that he wasn t rich and all the estate was left to his children who are now with an aunt then that he was staying somewhere not far from me but where i don t know i didn t ask but what what does he want to propose to dounia cried pulcheria alexandrovna in a fright did he tell you yes what was it i ll tell you afterwards raskolnikov ceased speaking and turned his attention to his tea pyotr petrovitch looked at his watch i am compelled to keep a business engagement and so i shall not be in your way he added with an air of some pique and he began getting up don t go pyotr petrovitch said dounia you intended to spend the evening besides you wrote yourself that you wanted to have an explanation with mother precisely so avdotya romanovna pyotr petrovitch answered impressively sitting down again but still holding his hat i certainly desired an explanation with you and your honoured mother upon a very important point indeed but as your brother cannot speak openly in my presence of some proposals of mr svidrigailov i too do not desire and am not able to speak openly in the presence of others of certain matters of the greatest gravity moreover my most weighty and urgent request has been disregarded assuming an aggrieved air luzhin relapsed into dignified silence your request that my brother should not be present at our meeting was disregarded solely at my instance said dounia you wrote that you had been insulted by my brother i think that this must be explained at once and you must be reconciled and if rodya really has insulted you then he should and will apologise pyotr petrovitch took a stronger line there are insults avdotya romanovna which no goodwill can make us forget there is a line in everything which it is dangerous to overstep and when it has been overstepped there is no return that wasn t what i was speaking of exactly pyotr petrovitch dounia interrupted with some impatience please understand that our whole future depends now on whether all this is explained and set right as soon as possible i tell you frankly at the start that i cannot look at it in any other light and if you have the least regard for me all this business must be ended to day however hard that may be i repeat that if my brother is to blame he will ask your forgiveness i am surprised at your putting the question like that said luzhin getting more and more irritated esteeming and so to say adoring you i may at the same time very well indeed be able to dislike some member of your family though i lay claim to the happiness of your hand i cannot accept duties incompatible with ah don t be so ready to take offence pyotr petrovitch dounia interrupted with feeling and be the sensible and generous man i have always considered and wish to consider you to be i ve given you a great promise i am your betrothed trust me in this matter and believe me i shall be capable of judging impartially my assuming the part of judge is as much a surprise for my brother as for you when i insisted on his coming to our interview to day after your letter i told him nothing of what i meant to do understand that if you are not reconciled i must choose between you it must be either you or he that is how the question rests on your side and on his i don t want to be mistaken in my choice and i must not be for your sake i must break off with my brother for my brother s sake i must break off with you i can find out for certain now whether he is a brother to me and i want to know it and of you whether i am dear to you whether you esteem me whether you are the husband for me avdotya romanovna luzhin declared huffily your words are of too much consequence to me i will say more they are offensive in view of the position i have the honour to occupy in relation to you to say nothing of your strange and offensive setting me on a level with an impertinent boy you admit the possibility of breaking your promise to me you say you or he showing thereby of how little consequence i am in your eyes i cannot let this pass considering the relationship and the obligations existing between us what cried dounia flushing i set your interest beside all that has hitherto been most precious in my life what has made up the whole of my life and here you are offended at my making too little account of you raskolnikov smiled sarcastically razumihin fidgeted but pyotr petrovitch did not accept the reproof on the contrary at every word he became more persistent and irritable as though he relished it love for the future partner of your life for your husband ought to outweigh your love for your brother he pronounced sententiously and in any case i cannot be put on the same level although i said so emphatically that i would not speak openly in your brother s presence nevertheless i intend now to ask your honoured mother for a necessary explanation on a point of great importance closely affecting my dignity your son he turned to pulcheria alexandrovna yesterday in the presence of mr razsudkin or i think that s it excuse me i have forgotten your surname he bowed politely to razumihin insulted me by misrepresenting the idea i expressed to you in a private conversation drinking coffee that is that marriage with a poor girl who has had experience of trouble is more advantageous from the conjugal point of view than with one who has lived in luxury since it is more profitable for the moral character your son intentionally exaggerated the significance of my words and made them ridiculous accusing me of malicious intentions and as far as i could see relied upon your correspondence with him i shall consider myself happy pulcheria alexandrovna if it is possible for you to convince me of an opposite conclusion and thereby considerately reassure me kindly let me know in what terms precisely you repeated my words in your letter to rodion romanovitch i don t remember faltered pulcheria alexandrovna i repeated them as i understood them i don t know how rodya repeated them to you perhaps he exaggerated he could not have exaggerated them except at your instigation pyotr petrovitch pulcheria alexandrovna declared with dignity the proof that dounia and i did not take your words in a very bad sense is the fact that we are here good mother said dounia approvingly then this is my fault again said luzhin aggrieved well pyotr petrovitch you keep blaming rodion but you yourself have just written what was false about him pulcheria alexandrovna added gaining courage i don t remember writing anything false you wrote raskolnikov said sharply not turning to luzhin that i gave money yesterday not to the widow of the man who was killed as was the fact but to his daughter whom i had never seen till yesterday you wrote this to make dissension between me and my family and for that object added coarse expressions about the conduct of a girl whom you don t know all that is mean slander excuse me sir said luzhin quivering with fury i enlarged upon your qualities and conduct in my letter solely in response to your sister s and mother s inquiries how i found you and what impression you made on me as for what you ve alluded to in my letter be so good as to point out one word of falsehood show that is that you didn t throw away your money and that there are not worthless persons in that family however unfortunate to my thinking you with all your virtues are not worth the little finger of that unfortunate girl at whom you throw stones would you go so far then as to let her associate with your mother and sister i have done so already if you care to know i made her sit down to day with mother and dounia rodya cried pulcheria alexandrovna dounia crimsoned razumihin knitted his brows luzhin smiled with lofty sarcasm you may see for yourself avdotya romanovna he said whether it is possible for us to agree i hope now that this question is at an end once and for all i will withdraw that i may not hinder the pleasures of family intimacy and the discussion of secrets he got up from his chair and took his hat but in withdrawing i venture to request that for the future i may be spared similar meetings and so to say compromises i appeal particularly to you honoured pulcheria alexandrovna on this subject the more as my letter was addressed to you and to no one else pulcheria alexandrovna was a little offended you seem to think we are completely under your authority pyotr petrovitch dounia has told you the reason your desire was disregarded she had the best intentions and indeed you write as though you were laying commands upon me are we to consider every desire of yours as a command let me tell you on the contrary that you ought to show particular delicacy and consideration for us now because we have thrown up everything and have come here relying on you and so we are in any case in a sense in your hands that is not quite true pulcheria alexandrovna especially at the present moment when the news has come of marfa petrovna s legacy which seems indeed very apropos judging from the new tone you take to me he added sarcastically judging from that remark we may certainly presume that you were reckoning on our helplessness dounia observed irritably but now in any case i cannot reckon on it and i particularly desire not to hinder your discussion of the secret proposals of arkady ivanovitch svidrigailov which he has entrusted to your brother and which have i perceive a great and possibly a very agreeable interest for you good heavens cried pulcheria alexandrovna razumihin could not sit still on his chair aren t you ashamed now sister asked raskolnikov i am ashamed rodya said dounia pyotr petrovitch go away she turned to him white with anger pyotr petrovitch had apparently not at all expected such a conclusion he had too much confidence in himself in his power and in the helplessness of his victims he could not believe it even now he turned pale and his lips quivered avdotya romanovna if i go out of this door now after such a dismissal then you may reckon on it i will never come back consider what you are doing my word is not to be shaken what insolence cried dounia springing up from her seat i don t want you to come back again what so that s how it stands cried luzhin utterly unable to the last moment to believe in the rupture and so completely thrown out of his reckoning now so that s how it stands but do you know avdotya romanovna that i might protest what right have you to speak to her like that pulcheria alexandrovna intervened hotly and what can you protest about what rights have you am i to give my dounia to a man like you go away leave us altogether we are to blame for having agreed to a wrong action and i above all but you have bound me pulcheria alexandrovna luzhin stormed in a frenzy by your promise and now you deny it and besides i have been led on account of that into expenses this last complaint was so characteristic of pyotr petrovitch that raskolnikov pale with anger and with the effort of restraining it could not help breaking into laughter but pulcheria alexandrovna was furious expenses what expenses are you speaking of our trunk but the conductor brought it for nothing for you mercy on us we have bound you what are you thinking about pyotr petrovitch it was you bound us hand and foot not we enough mother no more please avdotya romanovna implored pyotr petrovitch do be kind and go i am going but one last word he said quite unable to control himself your mamma seems to have entirely forgotten that i made up my mind to take you so to speak after the gossip of the town had spread all over the district in regard to your reputation disregarding public opinion for your sake and reinstating your reputation i certainly might very well reckon on a fitting return and might indeed look for gratitude on your part and my eyes have only now been opened i see myself that i may have acted very very recklessly in disregarding the universal verdict does the fellow want his head smashed cried razumihin jumping up you are a mean and spiteful man cried dounia not a word not a movement cried raskolnikov holding razumihin back then going close up to luzhin kindly leave the room he said quietly and distinctly and not a word more or pyotr petrovitch gazed at him for some seconds with a pale face that worked with anger then he turned went out and rarely has any man carried away in his heart such vindictive hatred as he felt against raskolnikov him and him alone he blamed for everything it is noteworthy that as he went downstairs he still imagined that his case was perhaps not utterly lost and that so far as the ladies were concerned all might very well indeed be set right again chapter iii the fact was that up to the last moment he had never expected such an ending he had been overbearing to the last degree never dreaming that two destitute and defenceless women could escape from his control this conviction was strengthened by his vanity and conceit a conceit to the point of fatuity pyotr petrovitch who had made his way up from insignificance was morbidly given to self admiration had the highest opinion of his intelligence and capacities and sometimes even gloated in solitude over his image in the glass but what he loved and valued above all was the money he had amassed by his labour and by all sorts of devices that money made him the equal of all who had been his superiors when he had bitterly reminded dounia that he had decided to take her in spite of evil report pyotr petrovitch had spoken with perfect sincerity and had indeed felt genuinely indignant at such black ingratitude and yet when he made dounia his offer he was fully aware of the groundlessness of all the gossip the story had been everywhere contradicted by marfa petrovna and was by then disbelieved by all the townspeople who were warm in dounia a defence and he would not have denied that he knew all that at the time yet he still thought highly of his own resolution in lifting dounia to his level and regarded it as something heroic in speaking of it to dounia he had let out the secret feeling he cherished and admired and he could not understand that others should fail to admire it too he had called on raskolnikov with the feelings of a benefactor who is about to reap the fruits of his good deeds and to hear agreeable flattery and as he went downstairs now he considered himself most undeservedly injured and unrecognised dounia was simply essential to him to do without her was unthinkable for many years he had had voluptuous dreams of marriage but he had gone on waiting and amassing money he brooded with relish in profound secret over the image of a girl virtuous poor she must be poor very young very pretty of good birth and education very timid one who had suffered much and was completely humbled before him one who would all her life look on him as her saviour worship him admire him and only him how many scenes how many amorous episodes he had imagined on this seductive and playful theme when his work was over and behold the dream of so many years was all but realised the beauty and education of avdotya romanovna had impressed him her helpless position had been a great allurement in her he had found even more than he dreamed of here was a girl of pride character virtue of education and breeding superior to his own he felt that and this creature would be slavishly grateful all her life for his heroic condescension and would humble herself in the dust before him and he would have absolute unbounded power over her not long before he had too after long reflection and hesitation made an important change in his career and was now entering on a wider circle of business with this change his cherished dreams of rising into a higher class of society seemed likely to be realised he was in fact determined to try his fortune in petersburg he knew that women could do a very great deal the fascination of a charming virtuous highly educated woman might make his way easier might do wonders in attracting people to him throwing an aureole round him and now everything was in ruins this sudden horrible rupture affected him like a clap of thunder it was like a hideous joke an absurdity he had only been a tiny bit masterful had not even time to speak out had simply made a joke been carried away and it had ended so seriously and of course too he did love dounia in his own way he already possessed her in his dreams and all at once no the next day the very next day it must all be set right smoothed over settled above all he must crush that conceited milksop who was the cause of it all with a sick feeling he could not help recalling razumihin too but he soon reassured himself on that score as though a fellow like that could be put on a level with him the man he really dreaded in earnest was svidrigailov he had in short a great deal to attend to no i i am more to blame than anyone said dounia kissing and embracing her mother i was tempted by his money but on my honour brother i had no idea he was such a base man if i had seen through him before nothing would have tempted me don t blame me brother god has delivered us god has delivered us pulcheria alexandrovna muttered but half consciously as though scarcely able to realise what had happened they were all relieved and in five minutes they were laughing only now and then dounia turned white and frowned remembering what had passed pulcheria alexandrovna was surprised to find that she too was glad she had only that morning thought rupture with luzhin a terrible misfortune razumihin was delighted he did not yet dare to express his joy fully but he was in a fever of excitement as though a ton weight had fallen off his heart now he had the right to devote his life to them to serve them anything might happen now but he felt afraid to think of further possibilities and dared not let his imagination range but raskolnikov sat still in the same place almost sullen and indifferent though he had been the most insistent on getting rid of luzhin he seemed now the least concerned at what had happened dounia could not help thinking that he was still angry with her and pulcheria alexandrovna watched him timidly what did svidrigailov say to you said dounia approaching him yes yes cried pulcheria alexandrovna raskolnikov raised his head he wants to make you a present of ten thousand roubles and he desires to see you once in my presence see her on no account cried pulcheria alexandrovna and how dare he offer her money then raskolnikov repeated rather dryly his conversation with svidrigailov omitting his account of the ghostly visitations of marfa petrovna wishing to avoid all unnecessary talk what answer did you give him asked dounia at first i said i would not take any message to you then he said that he would do his utmost to obtain an interview with you without my help he assured me that his passion for you was a passing infatuation now he has no feeling for you he doesn t want you to marry luzhin his talk was altogether rather muddled how do you explain him to yourself rodya how did he strike you i must confess i don t quite understand him he offers you ten thousand and yet says he is not well off he says he is going away and in ten minutes he forgets he has said it then he says is he going to be married and has already fixed on the girl no doubt he has a motive and probably a bad one but it s odd that he should be so clumsy about it if he had any designs against you of course i refused this money on your account once for all altogether i thought him very strange one might almost think he was mad but i may be mistaken that may only be the part he assumes the death of marfa petrovna seems to have made a great impression on him god rest her soul exclaimed pulcheria alexandrovna i shall always always pray for her where should we be now dounia without this three thousand it s as though it had fallen from heaven why rodya this morning we had only three roubles in our pocket and dounia and i were just planning to pawn her watch so as to avoid borrowing from that man until he offered help dounia seemed strangely impressed by svidrigailov s offer she still stood meditating he has got some terrible plan she said in a half whisper to herself almost shuddering raskolnikov noticed this disproportionate terror i fancy i shall have to see him more than once again he said to dounia we will watch him i will track him out cried razumihin vigorously i won t lose sight of him rodya has given me leave he said to me himself just now take care of my sister will you give me leave too avdotya romanovna dounia smiled and held out her hand but the look of anxiety did not leave her face pulcheria alexandrovna gazed at her timidly but the three thousand roubles had obviously a soothing effect on her a quarter of an hour later they were all engaged in a lively conversation even raskolnikov listened attentively for some time though he did not talk razumihin was the speaker and why why should you go away he flowed on ecstatically and what are you to do in a little town the great thing is you are all here together and you need one another you do need one another believe me for a time anyway take me into partnership and i assure you we ll plan a capital enterprise listen i ll explain it all in detail to you the whole project it all flashed into my head this morning before anything had happened i tell you what i have an uncle i must introduce him to you a most accommodating and respectable old man this uncle has got a capital of a thousand roubles and he lives on his pension and has no need of that money for the last two years he has been bothering me to borrow it from him and pay him six per cent interest i know what that means he simply wants to help me last year i had no need of it but this year i resolved to borrow it as soon as he arrived then you lend me another thousand of your three and we have enough for a start so we ll go into partnership and what are we going to do then razumihin began to unfold his project and he explained at length that almost all our publishers and booksellers know nothing at all of what they are selling and for that reason they are usually bad publishers and that any decent publications pay as a rule and give a profit sometimes a considerable one razumihin had indeed been dreaming of setting up as a publisher for the last two years he had been working in publishers offices and knew three european languages well though he had told raskolnikov six days before that he was schwach in german with an object of persuading him to take half his translation and half the payment for it he had told a lie then and raskolnikov knew he was lying why why should we let our chance slip when we have one of the chief means of success money of our own cried razumihin warmly of course there will be a lot of work but we will work you avdotya romanovna i rodion you get a splendid profit on some books nowadays and the great point of the business is that we shall know just what wants translating and we shall be translating publishing learning all at once i can be of use because i have experience for nearly two years i ve been scuttling about among the publishers and now i know every detail of their business you need not be a saint to make pots believe me and why why should we let our chance slip why i know and i kept the secret two or three books which one might get a hundred roubles simply for thinking of translating and publishing indeed and i would not take five hundred for the very idea of one of them and what do you think if i were to tell a publisher i dare say he d hesitate they are such blockheads and as for the business side printing paper selling you trust to me i know my way about we ll begin in a small way and go on to a large in any case it will get us our living and we shall get back our capital dounia s eyes shone i like what you are saying dmitri prokofitch she said i know nothing about it of course put in pulcheria alexandrovna it may be a good idea but again god knows it s new and untried of course we must remain here at least for a time she looked at rodya what do you think brother said dounia i think he s got a very good idea he answered of course it s too soon to dream of a publishing firm but we certainly might bring out five or six books and be sure of success i know of one book myself which would be sure to go well and as for his being able to manage it there s no doubt about that either he knows the business but we can talk it over later hurrah cried razumihin now stay there s a flat here in this house belonging to the same owner it s a special flat apart not communicating with these lodgings it s furnished rent moderate three rooms suppose you take them to begin with i ll pawn your watch to morrow and bring you the money and everything can be arranged then you can all three live together and rodya will be with you but where are you off to rodya what rodya you are going already pulcheria alexandrovna asked in dismay at such a minute cried razumihin dounia looked at her brother with incredulous wonder he held his cap in his hand he was preparing to leave them one would think you were burying me or saying good bye for ever he said somewhat oddly he attempted to smile but it did not turn out a smile but who knows perhaps it is the last time we shall see each other he let slip accidentally it was what he was thinking and it somehow was uttered aloud what is the matter with you cried his mother where are you going rodya asked dounia rather strangely oh i m quite obliged to he answered vaguely as though hesitating what he would say but there was a look of sharp determination in his white face i meant to say as i was coming here i meant to tell you mother and you dounia that it would be better for us to part for a time i feel ill i am not at peace i will come afterwards i will come of myself when it s possible i remember you and love you leave me leave me alone i decided this even before i m absolutely resolved on it whatever may come to me whether i come to ruin or not i want to be alone forget me altogether it s better don t inquire about me when i can i ll come of myself or i ll send for you perhaps it will all come back but now if you love me give me up else i shall begin to hate you i feel it good bye good god cried pulcheria alexandrovna both his mother and his sister were terribly alarmed razumihin was also rodya rodya be reconciled with us let us be as before cried his poor mother he turned slowly to the door and slowly went out of the room dounia overtook him brother what are you doing to mother she whispered her eyes flashing with indignation he looked dully at her no matter i shall come i m coming he muttered in an undertone as though not fully conscious of what he was saying and he went out of the room wicked heartless egoist cried dounia he is insane but not heartless he is mad don t you see it you re heartless after that razumihin whispered in her ear squeezing her hand tightly i shall be back directly he shouted to the horror stricken mother and he ran out of the room raskolnikov was waiting for him at the end of the passage i knew you would run after me he said go back to them be with them be with them to morrow and always i perhaps i shall come if i can good bye and without holding out his hand he walked away but where are you going what are you doing what s the matter with you how can you go on like this razumihin muttered at his wits end raskolnikov stopped once more once for all never ask me about anything i have nothing to tell you don t come to see me maybe i ll come here leave me but don t leave them do you understand me it was dark in the corridor they were standing near the lamp for a minute they were looking at one another in silence razumihin remembered that minute all his life raskolnikov s burning and intent eyes grew more penetrating every moment piercing into his soul into his consciousness suddenly razumihin started something strange as it were passed between them some idea some hint as it were slipped something awful hideous and suddenly understood on both sides razumihin turned pale do you understand now said raskolnikov his face twitching nervously go back go to them he said suddenly and turning quickly he went out of the house i will not attempt to describe how razumihin went back to the ladies how he soothed them how he protested that rodya needed rest in his illness protested that rodya was sure to come that he would come every day that he was very very much upset that he must not be irritated that he razumihin would watch over him would get him a doctor the best doctor a consultation in fact from that evening razumihin took his place with them as a son and a brother chapter iv raskolnikov went straight to the house on the canal bank where sonia lived it was an old green house of three storeys he found the porter and obtained from him vague directions as to the whereabouts of kapernaumov the tailor having found in the corner of the courtyard the entrance to the dark and narrow staircase he mounted to the second floor and came out into a gallery that ran round the whole second storey over the yard while he was wandering in the darkness uncertain where to turn for kapernaumov s door a door opened three paces from him he mechanically took hold of it who is there a woman s voice asked uneasily it s i come to see you answered raskolnikov and he walked into the tiny entry on a broken chair stood a candle in a battered copper candlestick it s you good heavens cried sonia weakly and she stood rooted to the spot which is your room this way and raskolnikov trying not to look at her hastened in a minute later sonia too came in with the candle set down the candlestick and completely disconcerted stood before him inexpressibly agitated and apparently frightened by his unexpected visit the colour rushed suddenly to her pale face and tears came into her eyes she felt sick and ashamed and happy too raskolnikov turned away quickly and sat on a chair by the table he scanned the room in a rapid glance it was a large but exceedingly low pitched room the only one let by the kapernaumovs to whose rooms a closed door led in the wall on the left in the opposite side on the right hand wall was another door always kept locked that led to the next flat which formed a separate lodging sonia s room looked like a barn it was a very irregular quadrangle and this gave it a grotesque appearance a wall with three windows looking out on to the canal ran aslant so that one corner formed a very acute angle and it was difficult to see in it without very strong light the other corner was disproportionately obtuse there was scarcely any furniture in the big room in the corner on the right was a bedstead beside it nearest the door a chair a plain deal table covered by a blue cloth stood against the same wall close to the door into the other flat two rush bottom chairs stood by the table on the opposite wall near the acute angle stood a small plain wooden chest of drawers looking as it were lost in a desert that was all there was in the room the yellow scratched and shabby wall paper was black in the corners it must have been damp and full of fumes in the winter there was every sign of poverty even the bedstead had no curtain sonia looked in silence at her visitor who was so attentively and unceremoniously scrutinising her room and even began at last to tremble with terror as though she was standing before her judge and the arbiter of her destinies i am late it s eleven isn t it he asked still not lifting his eyes yes muttered sonia oh yes it is she added hastily as though in that lay her means of escape my landlady s clock has just struck i heard it myself i ve come to you for the last time raskolnikov went on gloomily although this was the first time i may perhaps not see you again are you going away i don t know to morrow then you are not coming to katerina ivanovna to morrow sonia s voice shook i don t know i shall know to morrow morning never mind that i ve come to say one word he raised his brooding eyes to her and suddenly noticed that he was sitting down while she was all the while standing before him why are you standing sit down he said in a changed voice gentle and friendly she sat down he looked kindly and almost compassionately at her how thin you are what a hand quite transparent like a dead hand he took her hand sonia smiled faintly i have always been like that she said even when you lived at home yes of course you were he added abruptly and the expression of his face and the sound of his voice changed again suddenly he looked round him once more you rent this room from the kapernaumovs yes they live there through that door yes they have another room like this all in one room yes i should be afraid in your room at night he observed gloomily they are very good people very kind answered sonia who still seemed bewildered and all the furniture everything everything is theirs and they are very kind and the children too often come to see me they all stammer don t they yes he stammers and he s lame and his wife too it s not exactly that she stammers but she can t speak plainly she is a very kind woman and he used to be a house serf and there are seven children and it s only the eldest one that stammers and the others are simply ill but they don t stammer but where did you hear about them she added with some surprise your father told me then he told me all about you and how you went out at six o clock and came back at nine and how katerina ivanovna knelt down by your bed sonia was confused i fancied i saw him to day she whispered hesitatingly whom father i was walking in the street out there at the corner about ten o clock and he seemed to be walking in front it looked just like him i wanted to go to katerina ivanovna you were walking in the streets yes sonia whispered abruptly again overcome with confusion and looking down katerina ivanovna used to beat you i dare say oh no what are you saying no sonia looked at him almost with dismay you love her then love her of course said sonia with plaintive emphasis and she clasped her hands in distress ah you don t if you only knew you see she is quite like a child her mind is quite unhinged you see from sorrow and how clever she used to be how generous how kind ah you don t understand you don t understand sonia said this as though in despair wringing her hands in excitement and distress her pale cheeks flushed there was a look of anguish in her eyes it was clear that she was stirred to the very depths that she was longing to speak to champion to express something a sort of insatiable compassion if one may so express it was reflected in every feature of her face beat me how can you good heavens beat me and if she did beat me what then what of it you know nothing nothing about it she is so unhappy ah how unhappy and ill she is seeking righteousness she is pure she has such faith that there must be righteousness everywhere and she expects it and if you were to torture her she wouldn t do wrong she doesn t see that it s impossible for people to be righteous and she is angry at it like a child like a child she is good and what will happen to you sonia looked at him inquiringly they are left on your hands you see they were all on your hands before though and your father came to you to beg for drink well how will it be now i don t know sonia articulated mournfully will they stay there i don t know they are in debt for the lodging but the landlady i hear said to day that she wanted to get rid of them and katerina ivanovna says that she won t stay another minute how is it she is so bold she relies upon you oh no don t talk like that we are one we live like one sonia was agitated again and even angry as though a canary or some other little bird were to be angry and what could she do what what could she do she persisted getting hot and excited and how she cried to day her mind is unhinged haven t you noticed it at one minute she is worrying like a child that everything should be right to morrow the lunch and all that then she is wringing her hands spitting blood weeping and all at once she will begin knocking her head against the wall in despair then she will be comforted again she builds all her hopes on you she says that you will help her now and that she will borrow a little money somewhere and go to her native town with me and set up a boarding school for the daughters of gentlemen and take me to superintend it and we will begin a new splendid life and she kisses and hugs me comforts me and you know she has such faith such faith in her fancies one can t contradict her and all the day long she has been washing cleaning mending she dragged the wash tub into the room with her feeble hands and sank on the bed gasping for breath we went this morning to the shops to buy shoes for polenka and lida for theirs are quite worn out only the money we d reckoned wasn t enough not nearly enough and she picked out such dear little boots for she has taste you don t know and there in the shop she burst out crying before the shopmen because she hadn t enough ah it was sad to see her well after that i can understand your living like this raskolnikov said with a bitter smile and aren t you sorry for them aren t you sorry sonia flew at him again why i know you gave your last penny yourself though you d seen nothing of it and if you d seen everything oh dear and how often how often i ve brought her to tears only last week yes i only a week before his death i was cruel and how often i ve done it ah i ve been wretched at the thought of it all day sonia wrung her hands as she spoke at the pain of remembering it you were cruel yes i i i went to see them she went on weeping and father said read me something sonia my head aches read to me here s a book he had a book he had got from andrey semyonovitch lebeziatnikov he lives there he always used to get hold of such funny books and i said i can t stay as i didn t want to read and i d gone in chiefly to show katerina ivanovna some collars lizaveta the pedlar sold me some collars and cuffs cheap pretty new embroidered ones katerina ivanovna liked them very much she put them on and looked at herself in the glass and was delighted with them make me a present of them sonia she said please do please do she said she wanted them so much and when could she wear them they just reminded her of her old happy days she looked at herself in the glass admired herself and she has no clothes at all no things of her own hasn t had all these years and she never asks anyone for anything she is proud she d sooner give away everything and these she asked for she liked them so much and i was sorry to give them what use are they to you katerina ivanovna i said i spoke like that to her i ought not to have said that she gave me such a look and she was so grieved so grieved at my refusing her and it was so sad to see and she was not grieved for the collars but for my refusing i saw that ah if only i could bring it all back change it take back those words ah if i but it s nothing to you did you know lizaveta the pedlar yes did you know her sonia asked with some surprise katerina ivanovna is in consumption rapid consumption she will soon die said raskolnikov after a pause without answering her question oh no no no and sonia unconsciously clutched both his hands as though imploring that she should not but it will be better if she does die no not better not at all better sonia unconsciously repeated in dismay and the children what can you do except take them to live with you oh i don t know cried sonia almost in despair and she put her hands to her head it was evident that that idea had very often occurred to her before and he had only roused it again and what if even now while katerina ivanovna is alive you get ill and are taken to the hospital what will happen then he persisted pitilessly how can you that cannot be and sonia s face worked with awful terror cannot be raskolnikov went on with a harsh smile you are not insured against it are you what will happen to them then they will be in the street all of them she will cough and beg and knock her head against some wall as she did to day and the children will cry then she will fall down be taken to the police station and to the hospital she will die and the children oh no god will not let it be broke at last from sonia s overburdened bosom she listened looking imploringly at him clasping her hands in dumb entreaty as though it all depended upon him raskolnikov got up and began to walk about the room a minute passed sonia was standing with her hands and her head hanging in terrible dejection and can t you save put by for a rainy day he asked stopping suddenly before her no whispered sonia of course not have you tried he added almost ironically yes and it didn t come off of course not no need to ask and again he paced the room another minute passed you don t get money every day sonia was more confused than ever and colour rushed into her face again no she whispered with a painful effort it will be the same with polenka no doubt he said suddenly no no it can t be no sonia cried aloud in desperation as though she had been stabbed god would not allow anything so awful he lets others come to it no no god will protect her god she repeated beside herself but perhaps there is no god at all raskolnikov answered with a sort of malignance laughed and looked at her sonia s face suddenly changed a tremor passed over it she looked at him with unutterable reproach tried to say something but could not speak and broke into bitter bitter sobs hiding her face in her hands you say katerina ivanovna s mind is unhinged your own mind is unhinged he said after a brief silence five minutes passed he still paced up and down the room in silence not looking at her at last he went up to her his eyes glittered he put his two hands on her shoulders and looked straight into her tearful face his eyes were hard feverish and piercing his lips were twitching all at once he bent down quickly and dropping to the ground kissed her foot sonia drew back from him as from a madman and certainly he looked like a madman what are you doing to me she muttered turning pale and a sudden anguish clutched at her heart he stood up at once i did not bow down to you i bowed down to all the suffering of humanity he said wildly and walked away to the window listen he added turning to her a minute later i said just now to an insolent man that he was not worth your little finger and that i did my sister honour making her sit beside you ach you said that to them and in her presence cried sonia frightened sit down with me an honour why i m dishonourable ah why did you say that it was not because of your dishonour and your sin i said that of you but because of your great suffering but you are a great sinner that s true he added almost solemnly and your worst sin is that you have destroyed and betrayed yourself for nothing isn t that fearful isn t it fearful that you are living in this filth which you loathe so and at the same time you know yourself you ve only to open your eyes that you are not helping anyone by it not saving anyone from anything tell me he went on almost in a frenzy how this shame and degradation can exist in you side by side with other opposite holy feelings it would be better a thousand times better and wiser to leap into the water and end it all but what would become of them sonia asked faintly gazing at him with eyes of anguish but not seeming surprised at his suggestion raskolnikov looked strangely at her he read it all in her face so she must have had that thought already perhaps many times and earnestly she had thought out in her despair how to end it and so earnestly that now she scarcely wondered at his suggestion she had not even noticed the cruelty of his words the significance of his reproaches and his peculiar attitude to her shame she had of course not noticed either and that too was clear to him but he saw how monstrously the thought of her disgraceful shameful position was torturing her and had long tortured her what what he thought could hitherto have hindered her from putting an end to it only then he realised what those poor little orphan children and that pitiful half crazy katerina ivanovna knocking her head against the wall in her consumption meant for sonia but nevertheless it was clear to him again that with her character and the amount of education she had after all received she could not in any case remain so he was still confronted by the question how could she have remained so long in that position without going out of her mind since she could not bring herself to jump into the water of course he knew that sonia s position was an exceptional case though unhappily not unique and not infrequent indeed but that very exceptionalness her tinge of education her previous life might one would have thought have killed her at the first step on that revolting path what held her up surely not depravity all that infamy had obviously only touched her mechanically not one drop of real depravity had penetrated to her heart he saw that he saw through her as she stood before him there are three ways before her he thought the canal the madhouse or at last to sink into depravity which obscures the mind and turns the heart to stone the last idea was the most revolting but he was a sceptic he was young abstract and therefore cruel and so he could not help believing that the last end was the most likely but can that be true he cried to himself can that creature who has still preserved the purity of her spirit be consciously drawn at last into that sink of filth and iniquity can the process already have begun can it be that she has only been able to bear it till now because vice has begun to be less loathsome to her no no that cannot be he cried as sonia had just before no what has kept her from the canal till now is the idea of sin and they the children and if she has not gone out of her mind but who says she has not gone out of her mind is she in her senses can one talk can one reason as she does how can she sit on the edge of the abyss of loathsomeness into which she is slipping and refuse to listen when she is told of danger does she expect a miracle no doubt she does doesn t that all mean madness he stayed obstinately at that thought he liked that explanation indeed better than any other he began looking more intently at her so you pray to god a great deal sonia he asked her sonia did not speak he stood beside her waiting for an answer what should i be without god she whispered rapidly forcibly glancing at him with suddenly flashing eyes and squeezing his hand ah so that is it he thought and what does god do for you he asked probing her further sonia was silent a long while as though she could not answer her weak chest kept heaving with emotion be silent don t ask you don t deserve she cried suddenly looking sternly and wrathfully at him that s it that s it he repeated to himself he does everything she whispered quickly looking down again that s the way out that s the explanation he decided scrutinising her with eager curiosity with a new strange almost morbid feeling he gazed at that pale thin irregular angular little face those soft blue eyes which could flash with such fire such stern energy that little body still shaking with indignation and anger and it all seemed to him more and more strange almost impossible she is a religious maniac he repeated to himself there was a book lying on the chest of drawers he had noticed it every time he paced up and down the room now he took it up and looked at it it was the new testament in the russian translation it was bound in leather old and worn where did you get that he called to her across the room she was still standing in the same place three steps from the table it was brought me she answered as it were unwillingly not looking at him who brought it lizaveta i asked her for it lizaveta strange he thought everything about sonia seemed to him stranger and more wonderful every moment he carried the book to the candle and began to turn over the pages where is the story of lazarus he asked suddenly sonia looked obstinately at the ground and would not answer she was standing sideways to the table where is the raising of lazarus find it for me sonia she stole a glance at him you are not looking in the right place it s in the fourth gospel she whispered sternly without looking at him find it and read it to me he said he sat down with his elbow on the table leaned his head on his hand and looked away sullenly prepared to listen in three weeks time they ll welcome me in the madhouse i shall be there if i am not in a worse place he muttered to himself sonia heard raskolnikov s request distrustfully and moved hesitatingly to the table she took the book however haven t you read it she asked looking up at him across the table her voice became sterner and sterner long ago when i was at school read and haven t you heard it in church i haven t been do you often go n no whispered sonia raskolnikov smiled i understand and you won t go to your father s funeral to morrow yes i shall i was at church last week too i had a requiem service for whom for lizaveta she was killed with an axe his nerves were more and more strained his head began to go round were you friends with lizaveta yes she was good she used to come not often she couldn t we used to read together and talk she will see god the last phrase sounded strange in his ears and here was something new again the mysterious meetings with lizaveta and both of them religious maniacs i shall be a religious maniac myself soon it s infectious read he cried irritably and insistently sonia still hesitated her heart was throbbing she hardly dared to read to him he looked almost with exasperation at the unhappy lunatic what for you don t believe she whispered softly and as it were breathlessly read i want you to he persisted you used to read to lizaveta sonia opened the book and found the place her hands were shaking her voice failed her twice she tried to begin and could not bring out the first syllable now a certain man was sick named lazarus of bethany she forced herself at last to read but at the third word her voice broke like an overstrained string there was a catch in her breath raskolnikov saw in part why sonia could not bring herself to read to him and the more he saw this the more roughly and irritably he insisted on her doing so he understood only too well how painful it was for her to betray and unveil all that was her own he understood that these feelings really were her secret treasure which she had kept perhaps for years perhaps from childhood while she lived with an unhappy father and a distracted stepmother crazed by grief in the midst of starving children and unseemly abuse and reproaches but at the same time he knew now and knew for certain that although it filled her with dread and suffering yet she had a tormenting desire to read and to read to him that he might hear it and to read now whatever might come of it he read this in her eyes he could see it in her intense emotion she mastered herself controlled the spasm in her throat and went on reading the eleventh chapter of st john she went on to the nineteenth verse and many of the jews came to martha and mary to comfort them concerning their brother then martha as soon as she heard that jesus was coming went and met him but mary sat still in the house then said martha unto jesus lord if thou hadst been here my brother had not died but i know that even now whatsoever thou wilt ask of god god will give it thee then she stopped again with a shamefaced feeling that her voice would quiver and break again jesus said unto her thy brother shall rise again martha saith unto him i know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day jesus said unto her i am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believest thou this she saith unto him and drawing a painful breath sonia read distinctly and forcibly as though she were making a public confession of faith yea lord i believe that thou art the christ the son of god which should come into the world she stopped and looked up quickly at him but controlling herself went on reading raskolnikov sat without moving his elbows on the table and his eyes turned away she read to the thirty second verse then when mary was come where jesus was and saw him she fell down at his feet saying unto him lord if thou hadst been here my brother had not died when jesus therefore saw her weeping and the jews also weeping which came with her he groaned in the spirit and was troubled and said where have ye laid him they said unto him lord come and see jesus wept then said the jews behold how he loved him and some of them said could not this man which opened the eyes of the blind have caused that even this man should not have died raskolnikov turned and looked at her with emotion yes he had known it she was trembling in a real physical fever he had expected it she was getting near the story of the greatest miracle and a feeling of immense triumph came over her her voice rang out like a bell triumph and joy gave it power the lines danced before her eyes but she knew what she was reading by heart at the last verse could not this man which opened the eyes of the blind dropping her voice she passionately reproduced the doubt the reproach and censure of the blind disbelieving jews who in another moment would fall at his feet as though struck by thunder sobbing and believing and he he too is blinded and unbelieving he too will hear he too will believe yes yes at once now was what she was dreaming and she was quivering with happy anticipation jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave it was a cave and a stone lay upon it jesus said take ye away the stone martha the sister of him that was dead saith unto him lord by this time he stinketh for he hath been dead four days she laid emphasis on the word four jesus saith unto her said i not unto thee that if thou wouldest believe thou shouldest see the glory of god then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid and jesus lifted up his eyes and said father i thank thee that thou hast heard me and i knew that thou hearest me always but because of the people which stand by i said it that they may believe that thou hast sent me and when he thus had spoken he cried with a loud voice lazarus come forth and he that was dead came forth she read loudly cold and trembling with ecstasy as though she were seeing it before her eyes bound hand and foot with graveclothes and his face was bound about with a napkin jesus saith unto them loose him and let him go then many of the jews which came to mary and had seen the things which jesus did believed on him she could read no more closed the book and got up from her chair quickly that is all about the raising of lazarus she whispered severely and abruptly and turning away she stood motionless not daring to raise her eyes to him she still trembled feverishly the candle end was flickering out in the battered candlestick dimly lighting up in the poverty stricken room the murderer and the harlot who had so strangely been reading together the eternal book five minutes or more passed i came to speak of something raskolnikov said aloud frowning he got up and went to sonia she lifted her eyes to him in silence his face was particularly stern and there was a sort of savage determination in it i have abandoned my family to day he said my mother and sister i am not going to see them i ve broken with them completely what for asked sonia amazed her recent meeting with his mother and sister had left a great impression which she could not analyse she heard his news almost with horror i have only you now he added let us go together i ve come to you we are both accursed let us go our way together his eyes glittered as though he were mad sonia thought in her turn go where she asked in alarm and she involuntarily stepped back how do i know i only know it s the same road i know that and nothing more it s the same goal she looked at him and understood nothing she knew only that he was terribly infinitely unhappy no one of them will understand if you tell them but i have understood i need you that is why i have come to you i don t understand whispered sonia you ll understand later haven t you done the same you too have transgressed have had the strength to transgress you have laid hands on yourself you have destroyed a life your own it s all the same you might have lived in spirit and understanding but you ll end in the hay market but you won t be able to stand it and if you remain alone you ll go out of your mind like me you are like a mad creature already so we must go together on the same road let us go what for what s all this for said sonia strangely and violently agitated by his words what for because you can t remain like this that s why you must look things straight in the face at last and not weep like a child and cry that god won t allow it what will happen if you should really be taken to the hospital to morrow she is mad and in consumption she ll soon die and the children do you mean to tell me polenka won t come to grief haven t you seen children here at the street corners sent out by their mothers to beg i ve found out where those mothers live and in what surroundings children can t remain children there at seven the child is vicious and a thief yet children you know are the image of christ theirs is the kingdom of heaven he bade us honour and love them they are the humanity of the future what s to be done what s to be done repeated sonia weeping hysterically and wringing her hands what s to be done break what must be broken once for all that s all and take the suffering on oneself what you don t understand you ll understand later freedom and power and above all power over all trembling creation and all the ant heap that s the goal remember that that s my farewell message perhaps it s the last time i shall speak to you if i don t come to morrow you ll hear of it all and then remember these words and some day later on in years to come you ll understand perhaps what they meant if i come to morrow i ll tell you who killed lizaveta good bye sonia started with terror why do you know who killed her she asked chilled with horror looking wildly at him i know and will tell you only you i have chosen you out i m not coming to you to ask forgiveness but simply to tell you i chose you out long ago to hear this when your father talked of you and when lizaveta was alive i thought of it good bye don t shake hands to morrow he went out sonia gazed at him as at a madman but she herself was like one insane and felt it her head was going round good heavens how does he know who killed lizaveta what did those words mean it s awful but at the same time the idea did not enter her head not for a moment oh he must be terribly unhappy he has abandoned his mother and sister what for what has happened and what had he in his mind what did he say to her he had kissed her foot and said said yes he had said it clearly that he could not live without her oh merciful heavens sonia spent the whole night feverish and delirious she jumped up from time to time wept and wrung her hands then sank again into feverish sleep and dreamt of polenka katerina ivanovna and lizaveta of reading the gospel and him him with pale face with burning eyes kissing her feet weeping on the other side of the door on the right which divided sonia s room from madame resslich s flat was a room which had long stood empty a card was fixed on the gate and a notice stuck in the windows over the canal advertising it to let sonia had long been accustomed to the room s being uninhabited but all that time mr svidrigailov had been standing listening at the door of the empty room when raskolnikov went out he stood still thought a moment went on tiptoe to his own room which adjoined the empty one brought a chair and noiselessly carried it to the door that led to sonia s room the conversation had struck him as interesting and remarkable and he had greatly enjoyed it so much so that he brought a chair that he might not in the future to morrow for instance have to endure the inconvenience of standing a whole hour but might listen in comfort chapter v when next morning at eleven o clock punctually raskolnikov went into the department of the investigation of criminal causes and sent his name in to porfiry petrovitch he was surprised at being kept waiting so long it was at least ten minutes before he was summoned he had expected that they would pounce upon him but he stood in the waiting room and people who apparently had nothing to do with him were continually passing to and fro before him in the next room which looked like an office several clerks were sitting writing and obviously they had no notion who or what raskolnikov might be he looked uneasily and suspiciously about him to see whether there was not some guard some mysterious watch being kept on him to prevent his escape but there was nothing of the sort he saw only the faces of clerks absorbed in petty details then other people no one seemed to have any concern with him he might go where he liked for them the conviction grew stronger in him that if that enigmatic man of yesterday that phantom sprung out of the earth had seen everything they would not have let him stand and wait like that and would they have waited till he elected to appear at eleven either the man had not yet given information or or simply he knew nothing had seen nothing and how could he have seen anything and so all that had happened to him the day before was again a phantom exaggerated by his sick and overstrained imagination this conjecture had begun to grow strong the day before in the midst of all his alarm and despair thinking it all over now and preparing for a fresh conflict he was suddenly aware that he was trembling and he felt a rush of indignation at the thought that he was trembling with fear at facing that hateful porfiry petrovitch what he dreaded above all was meeting that man again he hated him with an intense unmitigated hatred and was afraid his hatred might betray him his indignation was such that he ceased trembling at once he made ready to go in with a cold and arrogant bearing and vowed to himself to keep as silent as possible to watch and listen and for once at least to control his overstrained nerves at that moment he was summoned to porfiry petrovitch he found porfiry petrovitch alone in his study his study was a room neither large nor small furnished with a large writing table that stood before a sofa upholstered in checked material a bureau a bookcase in the corner and several chairs all government furniture of polished yellow wood in the further wall there was a closed door beyond it there were no doubt other rooms on raskolnikov s entrance porfiry petrovitch had at once closed the door by which he had come in and they remained alone he met his visitor with an apparently genial and good tempered air and it was only after a few minutes that raskolnikov saw signs of a certain awkwardness in him as though he had been thrown out of his reckoning or caught in something very secret ah my dear fellow here you are in our domain began porfiry holding out both hands to him come sit down old man or perhaps you don t like to be called my dear fellow and old man tout court please don t think it too familiar here on the sofa raskolnikov sat down keeping his eyes fixed on him in our domain the apologies for familiarity the french phrase tout court were all characteristic signs he held out both hands to me but he did not give me one he drew it back in time struck him suspiciously both were watching each other but when their eyes met quick as lightning they looked away i brought you this paper about the watch here it is is it all right or shall i copy it again what a paper yes yes don t be uneasy it s all right porfiry petrovitch said as though in haste and after he had said it he took the paper and looked at it yes it s all right nothing more is needed he declared with the same rapidity and he laid the paper on the table a minute later when he was talking of something else he took it from the table and put it on his bureau i believe you said yesterday you would like to question me formally about my acquaintance with the murdered woman raskolnikov was beginning again why did i put in i believe passed through his mind in a flash why am i so uneasy at having put in that i believe came in a second flash and he suddenly felt that his uneasiness at the mere contact with porfiry at the first words at the first looks had grown in an instant to monstrous proportions and that this was fearfully dangerous his nerves were quivering his emotion was increasing it s bad it s bad i shall say too much again yes yes yes there s no hurry there s no hurry muttered porfiry petrovitch moving to and fro about the table without any apparent aim as it were making dashes towards the window the bureau and the table at one moment avoiding raskolnikov s suspicious glance then again standing still and looking him straight in the face his fat round little figure looked very strange like a ball rolling from one side to the other and rebounding back we ve plenty of time do you smoke have you your own here a cigarette he went on offering his visitor a cigarette you know i am receiving you here but my own quarters are through there you know my government quarters but i am living outside for the time i had to have some repairs done here it s almost finished now government quarters you know are a capital thing eh what do you think yes a capital thing answered raskolnikov looking at him almost ironically a capital thing a capital thing repeated porfiry petrovitch as though he had just thought of something quite different yes a capital thing he almost shouted at last suddenly staring at raskolnikov and stopping short two steps from him this stupid repetition was too incongruous in its ineptitude with the serious brooding and enigmatic glance he turned upon his visitor but this stirred raskolnikov s spleen more than ever and he could not resist an ironical and rather incautious challenge tell me please he asked suddenly looking almost insolently at him and taking a kind of pleasure in his own insolence i believe it s a sort of legal rule a sort of legal tradition for all investigating lawyers to begin their attack from afar with a trivial or at least an irrelevant subject so as to encourage or rather to divert the man they are cross examining to disarm his caution and then all at once to give him an unexpected knock down blow with some fatal question isn t that so it s a sacred tradition mentioned i fancy in all the manuals of the art yes yes why do you imagine that was why i spoke about government quarters eh and as he said this porfiry petrovitch screwed up his eyes and winked a good humoured crafty look passed over his face the wrinkles on his forehead were smoothed out his eyes contracted his features broadened and he suddenly went off into a nervous prolonged laugh shaking all over and looking raskolnikov straight in the face the latter forced himself to laugh too but when porfiry seeing that he was laughing broke into such a guffaw that he turned almost crimson raskolnikov s repulsion overcame all precaution he left off laughing scowled and stared with hatred at porfiry keeping his eyes fixed on him while his intentionally prolonged laughter lasted there was lack of precaution on both sides however for porfiry petrovitch seemed to be laughing in his visitor s face and to be very little disturbed at the annoyance with which the visitor received it the latter fact was very significant in raskolnikov s eyes he saw that porfiry petrovitch had not been embarrassed just before either but that he raskolnikov had perhaps fallen into a trap that there must be something some motive here unknown to him that perhaps everything was in readiness and in another moment would break upon him he went straight to the point at once rose from his seat and took his cap porfiry petrovitch he began resolutely though with considerable irritation yesterday you expressed a desire that i should come to you for some inquiries he laid special stress on the word inquiries i have come and if you have anything to ask me ask it and if not allow me to withdraw i have no time to spare i have to be at the funeral of that man who was run over of whom you know also he added feeling angry at once at having made this addition and more irritated at his anger i am sick of it all do you hear and have long been it s partly what made me ill in short he shouted feeling that the phrase about his illness was still more out of place in short kindly examine me or let me go at once and if you must examine me do so in the proper form i will not allow you to do so otherwise and so meanwhile good bye as we have evidently nothing to keep us now good heavens what do you mean what shall i question you about cackled porfiry petrovitch with a change of tone instantly leaving off laughing please don t disturb yourself he began fidgeting from place to place and fussily making raskolnikov sit down there s no hurry there s no hurry it s all nonsense oh no i m very glad you ve come to see me at last i look upon you simply as a visitor and as for my confounded laughter please excuse it rodion romanovitch rodion romanovitch that is your name it s my nerves you tickled me so with your witty observation i assure you sometimes i shake with laughter like an india rubber ball for half an hour at a time i m often afraid of an attack of paralysis do sit down please do or i shall think you are angry raskolnikov did not speak he listened watching him still frowning angrily he did sit down but still held his cap i must tell you one thing about myself my dear rodion romanovitch porfiry petrovitch continued moving about the room and again avoiding his visitor s eyes you see i m a bachelor a man of no consequence and not used to society besides i have nothing before me i m set i m running to seed and and have you noticed rodion romanovitch that in our petersburg circles if two clever men meet who are not intimate but respect each other like you and me it takes them half an hour before they can find a subject for conversation they are dumb they sit opposite each other and feel awkward everyone has subjects of conversation ladies for instance people in high society always have their subjects of conversation c est de rigueur but people of the middle sort like us thinking people that is are always tongue tied and awkward what is the reason of it whether it is the lack of public interest or whether it is we are so honest we don t want to deceive one another i don t know what do you think do put down your cap it looks as if you were just going it makes me uncomfortable i am so delighted raskolnikov put down his cap and continued listening in silence with a serious frowning face to the vague and empty chatter of porfiry petrovitch does he really want to distract my attention with his silly babble i can t offer you coffee here but why not spend five minutes with a friend porfiry pattered on and you know all these official duties please don t mind my running up and down excuse it my dear fellow i am very much afraid of offending you but exercise is absolutely indispensable for me i m always sitting and so glad to be moving about for five minutes i suffer from my sedentary life i always intend to join a gymnasium they say that officials of all ranks even privy councillors may be seen skipping gaily there there you have it modern science yes yes but as for my duties here inquiries and all such formalities you mentioned inquiries yourself just now i assure you these interrogations are sometimes more embarrassing for the interrogator than for the interrogated you made the observation yourself just now very aptly and wittily raskolnikov had made no observation of the kind one gets into a muddle a regular muddle one keeps harping on the same note like a drum there is to be a reform and we shall be called by a different name at least he he he and as for our legal tradition as you so wittily called it i thoroughly agree with you every prisoner on trial even the rudest peasant knows that they begin by disarming him with irrelevant questions as you so happily put it and then deal him a knock down blow he he he your felicitous comparison he he so you really imagined that i meant by government quarters he he you are an ironical person come i won t go on ah by the way yes one word leads to another you spoke of formality just now apropos of the inquiry you know but what s the use of formality in many cases it s nonsense sometimes one has a friendly chat and gets a good deal more out of it one can always fall back on formality allow me to assure you and after all what does it amount to an examining lawyer cannot be bounded by formality at every step the work of investigation is so to speak a free art in its own way he he he porfiry petrovitch took breath a moment he had simply babbled on uttering empty phrases letting slip a few enigmatic words and again reverting to incoherence he was almost running about the room moving his fat little legs quicker and quicker looking at the ground with his right hand behind his back while with his left making gesticulations that were extraordinarily incongruous with his words raskolnikov suddenly noticed that as he ran about the room he seemed twice to stop for a moment near the door as though he were listening is he expecting anything you are certainly quite right about it porfiry began gaily looking with extraordinary simplicity at raskolnikov which startled him and instantly put him on his guard certainly quite right in laughing so wittily at our legal forms he he some of these elaborate psychological methods are exceedingly ridiculous and perhaps useless if one adheres too closely to the forms yes i am talking of forms again well if i recognise or more strictly speaking if i suspect someone or other to be a criminal in any case entrusted to me you re reading for the law of course rodion romanovitch yes i was well then it is a precedent for you for the future though don t suppose i should venture to instruct you after the articles you publish about crime no i simply make bold to state it by way of fact if i took this man or that for a criminal why i ask should i worry him prematurely even though i had evidence against him in one case i may be bound for instance to arrest a man at once but another may be in quite a different position you know so why shouldn t i let him walk about the town a bit he he he but i see you don t quite understand so i ll give you a clearer example if i put him in prison too soon i may very likely give him so to speak moral support he he you re laughing raskolnikov had no idea of laughing he was sitting with compressed lips his feverish eyes fixed on porfiry petrovitch s yet that is the case with some types especially for men are so different you say evidence well there may be evidence but evidence you know can generally be taken two ways i am an examining lawyer and a weak man i confess it i should like to make a proof so to say mathematically clear i should like to make a chain of evidence such as twice two are four it ought to be a direct irrefutable proof and if i shut him up too soon even though i might be convinced he was the man i should very likely be depriving myself of the means of getting further evidence against him and how by giving him so to speak a definite position i shall put him out of suspense and set his mind at rest so that he will retreat into his shell they say that at sevastopol soon after alma the clever people were in a terrible fright that the enemy would attack openly and take sevastopol at once but when they saw that the enemy preferred a regular siege they were delighted i am told and reassured for the thing would drag on for two months at least you re laughing you don t believe me again of course you re right too you re right you re right these are special cases i admit but you must observe this my dear rodion romanovitch the general case the case for which all legal forms and rules are intended for which they are calculated and laid down in books does not exist at all for the reason that every case every crime for instance so soon as it actually occurs at once becomes a thoroughly special case and sometimes a case unlike any that s gone before very comic cases of that sort sometimes occur if i leave one man quite alone if i don t touch him and don t worry him but let him know or at least suspect every moment that i know all about it and am watching him day and night and if he is in continual suspicion and terror he ll be bound to lose his head he ll come of himself or maybe do something which will make it as plain as twice two are four it s delightful it may be so with a simple peasant but with one of our sort an intelligent man cultivated on a certain side it s a dead certainty for my dear fellow it s a very important matter to know on what side a man is cultivated and then there are nerves there are nerves you have overlooked them why they are all sick nervous and irritable and then how they all suffer from spleen that i assure you is a regular gold mine for us and it s no anxiety to me his running about the town free let him let him walk about for a bit i know well enough that i ve caught him and that he won t escape me where could he escape to he he abroad perhaps a pole will escape abroad but not here especially as i am watching and have taken measures will he escape into the depths of the country perhaps but you know peasants live there real rude russian peasants a modern cultivated man would prefer prison to living with such strangers as our peasants he he but that s all nonsense and on the surface it s not merely that he has nowhere to run to he is psychologically unable to escape me he he what an expression through a law of nature he can t escape me if he had anywhere to go have you seen a butterfly round a candle that s how he will keep circling and circling round me freedom will lose its attractions he ll begin to brood he ll weave a tangle round himself he ll worry himself to death what s more he will provide me with a mathematical proof if i only give him long enough interval and he ll keep circling round me getting nearer and nearer and then flop he ll fly straight into my mouth and i ll swallow him and that will be very amusing he he he you don t believe me raskolnikov made no reply he sat pale and motionless still gazing with the same intensity into porfiry s face it s a lesson he thought turning cold this is beyond the cat playing with a mouse like yesterday he can t be showing off his power with no motive prompting me he is far too clever for that he must have another object what is it it s all nonsense my friend you are pretending to scare me you ve no proofs and the man i saw had no real existence you simply want to make me lose my head to work me up beforehand and so to crush me but you are wrong you won t do it but why give me such a hint is he reckoning on my shattered nerves no my friend you are wrong you won t do it even though you have some trap for me let us see what you have in store for me and he braced himself to face a terrible and unknown ordeal at times he longed to fall on porfiry and strangle him this anger was what he dreaded from the beginning he felt that his parched lips were flecked with foam his heart was throbbing but he was still determined not to speak till the right moment he realised that this was the best policy in his position because instead of saying too much he would be irritating his enemy by his silence and provoking him into speaking too freely anyhow this was what he hoped for no i see you don t believe me you think i am playing a harmless joke on you porfiry began again getting more and more lively chuckling at every instant and again pacing round the room and to be sure you re right god has given me a figure that can awaken none but comic ideas in other people a buffoon but let me tell you and i repeat it excuse an old man my dear rodion romanovitch you are a man still young so to say in your first youth and so you put intellect above everything like all young people playful wit and abstract arguments fascinate you and that s for all the world like the old austrian hof kriegsrath as far as i can judge of military matters that is on paper they d beaten napoleon and taken him prisoner and there in their study they worked it all out in the cleverest fashion but look you general mack surrendered with all his army he he he i see i see rodion romanovitch you are laughing at a civilian like me taking examples out of military history but i can t help it it s my weakness i am fond of military science and i m ever so fond of reading all military histories i ve certainly missed my proper career i ought to have been in the army upon my word i ought i shouldn t have been a napoleon but i might have been a major he he well i ll tell you the whole truth my dear fellow about this special case i mean actual fact and a man s temperament my dear sir are weighty matters and it s astonishing how they sometimes deceive the sharpest calculation i listen to an old man am speaking seriously rodion romanovitch as he said this porfiry petrovitch who was scarcely five and thirty actually seemed to have grown old even his voice changed and he seemed to shrink together moreover i m a candid man am i a candid man or not what do you say i fancy i really am i tell you these things for nothing and don t even expect a reward for it he he well to proceed wit in my opinion is a splendid thing it is so to say an adornment of nature and a consolation of life and what tricks it can play so that it sometimes is hard for a poor examining lawyer to know where he is especially when he s liable to be carried away by his own fancy too for you know he is a man after all but the poor fellow is saved by the criminal s temperament worse luck for him but young people carried away by their own wit don t think of that when they overstep all obstacles as you wittily and cleverly expressed it yesterday he will lie that is the man who is a special case the incognito and he will lie well in the cleverest fashion you might think he would triumph and enjoy the fruits of his wit but at the most interesting the most flagrant moment he will faint of course there may be illness and a stuffy room as well but anyway anyway he s given us the idea he lied incomparably but he didn t reckon on his temperament that s what betrays him another time he will be carried away by his playful wit into making fun of the man who suspects him he will turn pale as it were on purpose to mislead but his paleness will be too natural too much like the real thing again he has given us an idea though his questioner may be deceived at first he will think differently next day if he is not a fool and of course it is like that at every step he puts himself forward where he is not wanted speaks continually when he ought to keep silent brings in all sorts of allegorical allusions he he comes and asks why didn t you take me long ago he he he and that can happen you know with the cleverest man the psychologist the literary man the temperament reflects everything like a mirror gaze into it and admire what you see but why are you so pale rodion romanovitch is the room stuffy shall i open the window oh don t trouble please cried raskolnikov and he suddenly broke into a laugh please don t trouble porfiry stood facing him paused a moment and suddenly he too laughed raskolnikov got up from the sofa abruptly checking his hysterical laughter porfiry petrovitch he began speaking loudly and distinctly though his legs trembled and he could scarcely stand i see clearly at last that you actually suspect me of murdering that old woman and her sister lizaveta let me tell you for my part that i am sick of this if you find that you have a right to prosecute me legally to arrest me then prosecute me arrest me but i will not let myself be jeered at to my face and worried his lips trembled his eyes glowed with fury and he could not restrain his voice i won t allow it he shouted bringing his fist down on the table do you hear that porfiry petrovitch i won t allow it good heavens what does it mean cried porfiry petrovitch apparently quite frightened rodion romanovitch my dear fellow what is the matter with you i won t allow it raskolnikov shouted again hush my dear man they ll hear and come in just think what could we say to them porfiry petrovitch whispered in horror bringing his face close to raskolnikov s i won t allow it i won t allow it raskolnikov repeated mechanically but he too spoke in a sudden whisper porfiry turned quickly and ran to open the window some fresh air and you must have some water my dear fellow you re ill and he was running to the door to call for some when he found a decanter of water in the corner come drink a little he whispered rushing up to him with the decanter it will be sure to do you good porfiry petrovitch s alarm and sympathy were so natural that raskolnikov was silent and began looking at him with wild curiosity he did not take the water however rodion romanovitch my dear fellow you ll drive yourself out of your mind i assure you ach ach have some water do drink a little he forced him to take the glass raskolnikov raised it mechanically to his lips but set it on the table again with disgust yes you ve had a little attack you ll bring back your illness again my dear fellow porfiry petrovitch cackled with friendly sympathy though he still looked rather disconcerted good heavens you must take more care of yourself dmitri prokofitch was here came to see me yesterday i know i know i ve a nasty ironical temper but what they made of it good heavens he came yesterday after you d been we dined and he talked and talked away and i could only throw up my hands in despair did he come from you but do sit down for mercy s sake sit down no not from me but i knew he went to you and why he went raskolnikov answered sharply you knew i knew what of it why this rodion romanovitch that i know more than that about you i know about everything i know how you went to take a flat at night when it was dark and how you rang the bell and asked about the blood so that the workmen and the porter did not know what to make of it yes i understand your state of mind at that time but you ll drive yourself mad like that upon my word you ll lose your head you re full of generous indignation at the wrongs you ve received first from destiny and then from the police officers and so you rush from one thing to another to force them to speak out and make an end of it all because you are sick of all this suspicion and foolishness that s so isn t it i have guessed how you feel haven t i only in that way you ll lose your head and razumihin s too he s too good a man for such a position you must know that you are ill and he is good and your illness is infectious for him i ll tell you about it when you are more yourself but do sit down for goodness sake please rest you look shocking do sit down raskolnikov sat down he no longer shivered he was hot all over in amazement he listened with strained attention to porfiry petrovitch who still seemed frightened as he looked after him with friendly solicitude but he did not believe a word he said though he felt a strange inclination to believe porfiry s unexpected words about the flat had utterly overwhelmed him how can it be he knows about the flat then he thought suddenly and he tells it me himself yes in our legal practice there was a case almost exactly similar a case of morbid psychology porfiry went on quickly a man confessed to murder and how he kept it up it was a regular hallucination he brought forward facts he imposed upon everyone and why he had been partly but only partly unintentionally the cause of a murder and when he knew that he had given the murderers the opportunity he sank into dejection it got on his mind and turned his brain he began imagining things and he persuaded himself that he was the murderer but at last the high court of appeal went into it and the poor fellow was acquitted and put under proper care thanks to the court of appeal tut tut tut why my dear fellow you may drive yourself into delirium if you have the impulse to work upon your nerves to go ringing bells at night and asking about blood i ve studied all this morbid psychology in my practice a man is sometimes tempted to jump out of a window or from a belfry just the same with bell ringing it s all illness rodion romanovitch you have begun to neglect your illness you should consult an experienced doctor what s the good of that fat fellow you are lightheaded you were delirious when you did all this for a moment raskolnikov felt everything going round is it possible is it possible flashed through his mind that he is still lying he can t be he can t be he rejected that idea feeling to what a degree of fury it might drive him feeling that that fury might drive him mad i was not delirious i knew what i was doing he cried straining every faculty to penetrate porfiry s game i was quite myself do you hear yes i hear and understand you said yesterday you were not delirious you were particularly emphatic about it i understand all you can tell me a ach listen rodion romanovitch my dear fellow if you were actually a criminal or were somehow mixed up in this damnable business would you insist that you were not delirious but in full possession of your faculties and so emphatically and persistently would it be possible quite impossible to my thinking if you had anything on your conscience you certainly ought to insist that you were delirious that s so isn t it there was a note of slyness in this inquiry raskolnikov drew back on the sofa as porfiry bent over him and stared in silent perplexity at him another thing about razumihin you certainly ought to have said that he came of his own accord to have concealed your part in it but you don t conceal it you lay stress on his coming at your instigation raskolnikov had not done so a chill went down his back you keep telling lies he said slowly and weakly twisting his lips into a sickly smile you are trying again to show that you know all my game that you know all i shall say beforehand he said conscious himself that he was not weighing his words as he ought you want to frighten me or you are simply laughing at me he still stared at him as he said this and again there was a light of intense hatred in his eyes you keep lying he said you know perfectly well that the best policy for the criminal is to tell the truth as nearly as possible to conceal as little as possible i don t believe you what a wily person you are porfiry tittered there s no catching you you ve a perfect monomania so you don t believe me but still you do believe me you believe a quarter i ll soon make you believe the whole because i have a sincere liking for you and genuinely wish you good raskolnikov s lips trembled yes i do went on porfiry touching raskolnikov s arm genially you must take care of your illness besides your mother and sister are here now you must think of them you must soothe and comfort them and you do nothing but frighten them what has that to do with you how do you know it what concern is it of yours you are keeping watch on me and want to let me know it good heavens why i learnt it all from you yourself you don t notice that in your excitement you tell me and others everything from razumihin too i learnt a number of interesting details yesterday no you interrupted me but i must tell you that for all your wit your suspiciousness makes you lose the common sense view of things to return to bell ringing for instance i an examining lawyer have betrayed a precious thing like that a real fact for it is a fact worth having and you see nothing in it why if i had the slightest suspicion of you should i have acted like that no i should first have disarmed your suspicions and not let you see i knew of that fact should have diverted your attention and suddenly have dealt you a knock down blow your expression saying and what were you doing sir pray at ten or nearly eleven at the murdered woman s flat and why did you ring the bell and why did you ask about blood and why did you invite the porters to go with you to the police station to the lieutenant that s how i ought to have acted if i had a grain of suspicion of you i ought to have taken your evidence in due form searched your lodging and perhaps have arrested you too so i have no suspicion of you since i have not done that but you can t look at it normally and you see nothing i say again raskolnikov started so that porfiry petrovitch could not fail to perceive it you are lying all the while he cried i don t know your object but you are lying you did not speak like that just now and i cannot be mistaken i am lying porfiry repeated apparently incensed but preserving a good humoured and ironical face as though he were not in the least concerned at raskolnikov s opinion of him i am lying but how did i treat you just now i the examining lawyer prompting you and giving you every means for your defence illness i said delirium injury melancholy and the police officers and all the rest of it ah he he he though indeed all those psychological means of defence are not very reliable and cut both ways illness delirium i don t remember that s all right but why my good sir in your illness and in your delirium were you haunted by just those delusions and not by any others there may have been others eh he he he raskolnikov looked haughtily and contemptuously at him briefly he said loudly and imperiously rising to his feet and in so doing pushing porfiry back a little briefly i want to know do you acknowledge me perfectly free from suspicion or not tell me porfiry petrovitch tell me once for all and make haste what a business i m having with you cried porfiry with a perfectly good humoured sly and composed face and why do you want to know why do you want to know so much since they haven t begun to worry you why you are like a child asking for matches and why are you so uneasy why do you force yourself upon us eh he he he i repeat raskolnikov cried furiously that i can t put up with it with what uncertainty interrupted porfiry don t jeer at me i won t have it i tell you i won t have it i can t and i won t do you hear do you hear he shouted bringing his fist down on the table again hush hush they ll overhear i warn you seriously take care of yourself i am not joking porfiry whispered but this time there was not the look of old womanish good nature and alarm in his face now he was peremptory stern frowning and for once laying aside all mystification but this was only for an instant raskolnikov bewildered suddenly fell into actual frenzy but strange to say he again obeyed the command to speak quietly though he was in a perfect paroxysm of fury i will not allow myself to be tortured he whispered instantly recognising with hatred that he could not help obeying the command and driven to even greater fury by the thought arrest me search me but kindly act in due form and don t play with me don t dare don t worry about the form porfiry interrupted with the same sly smile as it were gloating with enjoyment over raskolnikov i invited you to see me quite in a friendly way i don t want your friendship and i spit on it do you hear and here i take my cap and go what will you say now if you mean to arrest me he took up his cap and went to the door and won t you see my little surprise chuckled porfiry again taking him by the arm and stopping him at the door he seemed to become more playful and good humoured which maddened raskolnikov what surprise he asked standing still and looking at porfiry in alarm my little surprise it s sitting there behind the door he he he he pointed to the locked door i locked him in that he should not escape what is it where what raskolnikov walked to the door and would have opened it but it was locked it s locked here is the key and he brought a key out of his pocket you are lying roared raskolnikov without restraint you lie you damned punchinello and he rushed at porfiry who retreated to the other door not at all alarmed i understand it all you are lying and mocking so that i may betray myself to you why you could not betray yourself any further my dear rodion romanovitch you are in a passion don t shout i shall call the clerks you are lying call the clerks you knew i was ill and tried to work me into a frenzy to make me betray myself that was your object produce your facts i understand it all you ve no evidence you have only wretched rubbishly suspicions like zametov s you knew my character you wanted to drive me to fury and then to knock me down with priests and deputies are you waiting for them eh what are you waiting for where are they produce them why deputies my good man what things people will imagine and to do so would not be acting in form as you say you don t know the business my dear fellow and there s no escaping form as you see porfiry muttered listening at the door through which a noise could be heard ah they re coming cried raskolnikov you ve sent for them you expected them well produce them all your deputies your witnesses what you like i am ready but at this moment a strange incident occurred something so unexpected that neither raskolnikov nor porfiry petrovitch could have looked for such a conclusion to their interview chapter vi when he remembered the scene afterwards this is how raskolnikov saw it the noise behind the door increased and suddenly the door was opened a little what is it cried porfiry petrovitch annoyed why i gave orders for an instant there was no answer but it was evident that there were several persons at the door and that they were apparently pushing somebody back what is it porfiry petrovitch repeated uneasily the prisoner nikolay has been brought someone answered he is not wanted take him away let him wait what s he doing here how irregular cried porfiry rushing to the door but he began the same voice and suddenly ceased two seconds not more were spent in actual struggle then someone gave a violent shove and then a man very pale strode into the room this man s appearance was at first sight very strange he stared straight before him as though seeing nothing there was a determined gleam in his eyes at the same time there was a deathly pallor in his face as though he were being led to the scaffold his white lips were faintly twitching he was dressed like a workman and was of medium height very young slim his hair cut in round crop with thin spare features the man whom he had thrust back followed him into the room and succeeded in seizing him by the shoulder he was a warder but nikolay pulled his arm away several persons crowded inquisitively into the doorway some of them tried to get in all this took place almost instantaneously go away it s too soon wait till you are sent for why have you brought him so soon porfiry petrovitch muttered extremely annoyed and as it were thrown out of his reckoning but nikolay suddenly knelt down what s the matter cried porfiry surprised i am guilty mine is the sin i am the murderer nikolay articulated suddenly rather breathless but speaking fairly loudly for ten seconds there was silence as though all had been struck dumb even the warder stepped back mechanically retreated to the door and stood immovable what is it cried porfiry petrovitch recovering from his momentary stupefaction i am the murderer repeated nikolay after a brief pause what you what whom did you kill porfiry petrovitch was obviously bewildered nikolay again was silent for a moment alyona ivanovna and her sister lizaveta ivanovna i killed with an axe darkness came over me he added suddenly and was again silent he still remained on his knees porfiry petrovitch stood for some moments as though meditating but suddenly roused himself and waved back the uninvited spectators they instantly vanished and closed the door then he looked towards raskolnikov who was standing in the corner staring wildly at nikolay and moved towards him but stopped short looked from nikolay to raskolnikov and then again at nikolay and seeming unable to restrain himself darted at the latter you re in too great a hurry he shouted at him almost angrily i didn t ask you what came over you speak did you kill them i am the murderer i want to give evidence nikolay pronounced ach what did you kill them with an axe i had it ready ach he is in a hurry alone nikolay did not understand the question did you do it alone yes alone and mitka is not guilty and had no share in it don t be in a hurry about mitka a ach how was it you ran downstairs like that at the time the porters met you both it was to put them off the scent i ran after mitka nikolay replied hurriedly as though he had prepared the answer i knew it cried porfiry with vexation it s not his own tale he is telling he muttered as though to himself and suddenly his eyes rested on raskolnikov again he was apparently so taken up with nikolay that for a moment he had forgotten raskolnikov he was a little taken aback my dear rodion romanovitch excuse me he flew up to him this won t do i m afraid you must go it s no good your staying i will you see what a surprise good bye and taking him by the arm he showed him to the door i suppose you didn t expect it said raskolnikov who though he had not yet fully grasped the situation had regained his courage you did not expect it either my friend see how your hand is trembling he he you re trembling too porfiry petrovitch yes i am i didn t expect it they were already at the door porfiry was impatient for raskolnikov to be gone and your little surprise aren t you going to show it to me raskolnikov said sarcastically why his teeth are chattering as he asks he he you are an ironical person come till we meet i believe we can say good bye that s in god s hands muttered porfiry with an unnatural smile as he walked through the office raskolnikov noticed that many people were looking at him among them he saw the two porters from the house whom he had invited that night to the police station they stood there waiting but he was no sooner on the stairs than he heard the voice of porfiry petrovitch behind him turning round he saw the latter running after him out of breath one word rodion romanovitch as to all the rest it s in god s hands but as a matter of form there are some questions i shall have to ask you so we shall meet again shan t we and porfiry stood still facing him with a smile shan t we he added again he seemed to want to say something more but could not speak out you must forgive me porfiry petrovitch for what has just passed i lost my temper began raskolnikov who had so far regained his courage that he felt irresistibly inclined to display his coolness don t mention it don t mention it porfiry replied almost gleefully i myself too i have a wicked temper i admit it but we shall meet again if it s god s will we may see a great deal of one another and will get to know each other through and through added raskolnikov yes know each other through and through assented porfiry petrovitch and he screwed up his eyes looking earnestly at raskolnikov now you re going to a birthday party to a funeral of course the funeral take care of yourself and get well i don t know what to wish you said raskolnikov who had begun to descend the stairs but looked back again i should like to wish you success but your office is such a comical one why comical porfiry petrovitch had turned to go but he seemed to prick up his ears at this why how you must have been torturing and harassing that poor nikolay psychologically after your fashion till he confessed you must have been at him day and night proving to him that he was the murderer and now that he has confessed you ll begin vivisecting him again you are lying you ll say you are not the murderer you can t be it s not your own tale you are telling you must admit it s a comical business he he he you noticed then that i said to nikolay just now that it was not his own tale he was telling how could i help noticing it he he you are quick witted you notice everything you ve really a playful mind and you always fasten on the comic side he he they say that was the marked characteristic of gogol among the writers yes of gogol yes of gogol i shall look forward to meeting you so shall i raskolnikov walked straight home he was so muddled and bewildered that on getting home he sat for a quarter of an hour on the sofa trying to collect his thoughts he did not attempt to think about nikolay he was stupefied he felt that his confession was something inexplicable amazing something beyond his understanding but nikolay s confession was an actual fact the consequences of this fact were clear to him at once its falsehood could not fail to be discovered and then they would be after him again till then at least he was free and must do something for himself for the danger was imminent but how imminent his position gradually became clear to him remembering sketchily the main outlines of his recent scene with porfiry he could not help shuddering again with horror of course he did not yet know all porfiry s aims he could not see into all his calculations but he had already partly shown his hand and no one knew better than raskolnikov how terrible porfiry s lead had been for him a little more and he might have given himself away completely circumstantially knowing his nervous temperament and from the first glance seeing through him porfiry though playing a bold game was bound to win there s no denying that raskolnikov had compromised himself seriously but no facts had come to light as yet there was nothing positive but was he taking a true view of the position wasn t he mistaken what had porfiry been trying to get at had he really some surprise prepared for him and what was it had he really been expecting something or not how would they have parted if it had not been for the unexpected appearance of nikolay porfiry had shown almost all his cards of course he had risked something in showing them and if he had really had anything up his sleeve raskolnikov reflected he would have shown that too what was that surprise was it a joke had it meant anything could it have concealed anything like a fact a piece of positive evidence his yesterday s visitor what had become of him where was he to day if porfiry really had any evidence it must be connected with him he sat on the sofa with his elbows on his knees and his face hidden in his hands he was still shivering nervously at last he got up took his cap thought a minute and went to the door he had a sort of presentiment that for to day at least he might consider himself out of danger he had a sudden sense almost of joy he wanted to make haste to katerina ivanovna s he would be too late for the funeral of course but he would be in time for the memorial dinner and there at once he would see sonia he stood still thought a moment and a suffering smile came for a moment on to his lips to day to day he repeated to himself yes to day so it must be but as he was about to open the door it began opening of itself he started and moved back the door opened gently and slowly and there suddenly appeared a figure yesterday s visitor from underground the man stood in the doorway looked at raskolnikov without speaking and took a step forward into the room he was exactly the same as yesterday the same figure the same dress but there was a great change in his face he looked dejected and sighed deeply if he had only put his hand up to his cheek and leaned his head on one side he would have looked exactly like a peasant woman what do you want asked raskolnikov numb with terror the man was still silent but suddenly he bowed down almost to the ground touching it with his finger what is it cried raskolnikov i have sinned the man articulated softly how by evil thoughts they looked at one another i was vexed when you came perhaps in drink and bade the porters go to the police station and asked about the blood i was vexed that they let you go and took you for drunken i was so vexed that i lost my sleep and remembering the address we came here yesterday and asked for you who came raskolnikov interrupted instantly beginning to recollect i did i ve wronged you then you come from that house i was standing at the gate with them don t you remember we have carried on our trade in that house for years past we cure and prepare hides we take work home most of all i was vexed and the whole scene of the day before yesterday in the gateway came clearly before raskolnikov s mind he recollected that there had been several people there besides the porters women among them he remembered one voice had suggested taking him straight to the police station he could not recall the face of the speaker and even now he did not recognise it but he remembered that he had turned round and made him some answer so this was the solution of yesterday s horror the most awful thought was that he had been actually almost lost had almost done for himself on account of such a trivial circumstance so this man could tell nothing except his asking about the flat and the blood stains so porfiry too had nothing but that delirium no facts but this psychology which cuts both ways nothing positive so if no more facts come to light and they must not they must not then then what can they do to him how can they convict him even if they arrest him and porfiry then had only just heard about the flat and had not known about it before was it you who told porfiry that i d been there he cried struck by a sudden idea what porfiry the head of the detective department yes the porters did not go there but i went to day i got there two minutes before you and i heard i heard it all how he worried you where what when why in the next room i was sitting there all the time what why then you were the surprise but how could it happen upon my word i saw that the porters did not want to do what i said began the man for it s too late said they and maybe he ll be angry that we did not come at the time i was vexed and i lost my sleep and i began making inquiries and finding out yesterday where to go i went to day the first time i went he wasn t there when i came an hour later he couldn t see me i went the third time and they showed me in i informed him of everything just as it happened and he began skipping about the room and punching himself on the chest what do you scoundrels mean by it if i d known about it i should have arrested him then he ran out called somebody and began talking to him in the corner then he turned to me scolding and questioning me he scolded me a great deal and i told him everything and i told him that you didn t dare to say a word in answer to me yesterday and that you didn t recognise me and he fell to running about again and kept hitting himself on the chest and getting angry and running about and when you were announced he told me to go into the next room sit there a bit he said don t move whatever you may hear and he set a chair there for me and locked me in perhaps he said i may call you and when nikolay d been brought he let me out as soon as you were gone i shall send for you again and question you he said and did he question nikolay while you were there he got rid of me as he did of you before he spoke to nikolay the man stood still and again suddenly bowed down touching the ground with his finger forgive me for my evil thoughts and my slander may god forgive you answered raskolnikov and as he said this the man bowed down again but not to the ground turned slowly and went out of the room it all cuts both ways now it all cuts both ways repeated raskolnikov and he went out more confident than ever now we ll make a fight for it he said with a malicious smile as he went down the stairs his malice was aimed at himself with shame and contempt he recollected his cowardice part v chapter i the morning that followed the fateful interview with dounia and her mother brought sobering influences to bear on pyotr petrovitch intensely unpleasant as it was he was forced little by little to accept as a fact beyond recall what had seemed to him only the day before fantastic and incredible the black snake of wounded vanity had been gnawing at his heart all night when he got out of bed pyotr petrovitch immediately looked in the looking glass he was afraid that he had jaundice however his health seemed unimpaired so far and looking at his noble clear skinned countenance which had grown fattish of late pyotr petrovitch for an instant was positively comforted in the conviction that he would find another bride and perhaps even a better one but coming back to the sense of his present position he turned aside and spat vigorously which excited a sarcastic smile in andrey semyonovitch lebeziatnikov the young friend with whom he was staying that smile pyotr petrovitch noticed and at once set it down against his young friend s account he had set down a good many points against him of late his anger was redoubled when he reflected that he ought not to have told andrey semyonovitch about the result of yesterday s interview that was the second mistake he had made in temper through impulsiveness and irritability moreover all that morning one unpleasantness followed another he even found a hitch awaiting him in his legal case in the senate he was particularly irritated by the owner of the flat which had been taken in view of his approaching marriage and was being redecorated at his own expense the owner a rich german tradesman would not entertain the idea of breaking the contract which had just been signed and insisted on the full forfeit money though pyotr petrovitch would be giving him back the flat practically redecorated in the same way the upholsterers refused to return a single rouble of the instalment paid for the furniture purchased but not yet removed to the flat am i to get married simply for the sake of the furniture pyotr petrovitch ground his teeth and at the same time once more he had a gleam of desperate hope can all that be really so irrevocably over is it no use to make another effort the thought of dounia sent a voluptuous pang through his heart he endured anguish at that moment and if it had been possible to slay raskolnikov instantly by wishing it pyotr petrovitch would promptly have uttered the wish it was my mistake too not to have given them money he thought as he returned dejectedly to lebeziatnikov s room and why on earth was i such a jew it was false economy i meant to keep them without a penny so that they should turn to me as their providence and look at them foo if i d spent some fifteen hundred roubles on them for the trousseau and presents on knick knacks dressing cases jewellery materials and all that sort of trash from knopp s and the english shop my position would have been better and stronger they could not have refused me so easily they are the sort of people that would feel bound to return money and presents if they broke it off and they would find it hard to do it and their conscience would prick them how can we dismiss a man who has hitherto been so generous and delicate h m i ve made a blunder and grinding his teeth again pyotr petrovitch called himself a fool but not aloud of course he returned home twice as irritated and angry as before the preparations for the funeral dinner at katerina ivanovna s excited his curiosity as he passed he had heard about it the day before he fancied indeed that he had been invited but absorbed in his own cares he had paid no attention inquiring of madame lippevechsel who was busy laying the table while katerina ivanovna was away at the cemetery he heard that the entertainment was to be a great affair that all the lodgers had been invited among them some who had not known the dead man that even andrey semyonovitch lebeziatnikov was invited in spite of his previous quarrel with katerina ivanovna that he pyotr petrovitch was not only invited but was eagerly expected as he was the most important of the lodgers amalia ivanovna herself had been invited with great ceremony in spite of the recent unpleasantness and so she was very busy with preparations and was taking a positive pleasure in them she was moreover dressed up to the nines all in new black silk and she was proud of it all this suggested an idea to pyotr petrovitch and he went into his room or rather lebeziatnikov s somewhat thoughtful he had learnt that raskolnikov was to be one of the guests andrey semyonovitch had been at home all the morning the attitude of pyotr petrovitch to this gentleman was strange though perhaps natural pyotr petrovitch had despised and hated him from the day he came to stay with him and at the same time he seemed somewhat afraid of him he had not come to stay with him on his arrival in petersburg simply from parsimony though that had been perhaps his chief object he had heard of andrey semyonovitch who had once been his ward as a leading young progressive who was taking an important part in certain interesting circles the doings of which were a legend in the provinces it had impressed pyotr petrovitch these powerful omniscient circles who despised everyone and showed everyone up had long inspired in him a peculiar but quite vague alarm he had not of course been able to form even an approximate notion of what they meant he like everyone had heard that there were especially in petersburg progressives of some sort nihilists and so on and like many people he exaggerated and distorted the significance of those words to an absurd degree what for many years past he had feared more than anything was being shown up and this was the chief ground for his continual uneasiness at the thought of transferring his business to petersburg he was afraid of this as little children are sometimes panic stricken some years before when he was just entering on his own career he had come upon two cases in which rather important personages in the province patrons of his had been cruelly shown up one instance had ended in great scandal for the person attacked and the other had very nearly ended in serious trouble for this reason pyotr petrovitch intended to go into the subject as soon as he reached petersburg and if necessary to anticipate contingencies by seeking the favour of our younger generation he relied on andrey semyonovitch for this and before his visit to raskolnikov he had succeeded in picking up some current phrases he soon discovered that andrey semyonovitch was a commonplace simpleton but that by no means reassured pyotr petrovitch even if he had been certain that all the progressives were fools like him it would not have allayed his uneasiness all the doctrines the ideas the systems with which andrey semyonovitch pestered him had no interest for him he had his own object he simply wanted to find out at once what was happening here had these people any power or not had he anything to fear from them would they expose any enterprise of his and what precisely was now the object of their attacks could he somehow make up to them and get round them if they really were powerful was this the thing to do or not couldn t he gain something through them in fact hundreds of questions presented themselves andrey semyonovitch was an anaemic scrofulous little man with strangely flaxen mutton chop whiskers of which he was very proud he was a clerk and had almost always something wrong with his eyes he was rather soft hearted but self confident and sometimes extremely conceited in speech which had an absurd effect incongruous with his little figure he was one of the lodgers most respected by amalia ivanovna for he did not get drunk and paid regularly for his lodgings andrey semyonovitch really was rather stupid he attached himself to the cause of progress and our younger generation from enthusiasm he was one of the numerous and varied legion of dullards of half animate abortions conceited half educated coxcombs who attach themselves to the idea most in fashion only to vulgarise it and who caricature every cause they serve however sincerely though lebeziatnikov was so good natured he too was beginning to dislike pyotr petrovitch this happened on both sides unconsciously however simple andrey semyonovitch might be he began to see that pyotr petrovitch was duping him and secretly despising him and that he was not the right sort of man he had tried expounding to him the system of fourier and the darwinian theory but of late pyotr petrovitch began to listen too sarcastically and even to be rude the fact was he had begun instinctively to guess that lebeziatnikov was not merely a commonplace simpleton but perhaps a liar too and that he had no connections of any consequence even in his own circle but had simply picked things up third hand and that very likely he did not even know much about his own work of propaganda for he was in too great a muddle a fine person he would be to show anyone up it must be noted by the way that pyotr petrovitch had during those ten days eagerly accepted the strangest praise from andrey semyonovitch he had not protested for instance when andrey semyonovitch belauded him for being ready to contribute to the establishment of the new commune or to abstain from christening his future children or to acquiesce if dounia were to take a lover a month after marriage and so on pyotr petrovitch so enjoyed hearing his own praises that he did not disdain even such virtues when they were attributed to him pyotr petrovitch had had occasion that morning to realise some five per cent bonds and now he sat down to the table and counted over bundles of notes andrey semyonovitch who hardly ever had any money walked about the room pretending to himself to look at all those bank notes with indifference and even contempt nothing would have convinced pyotr petrovitch that andrey semyonovitch could really look on the money unmoved and the latter on his side kept thinking bitterly that pyotr petrovitch was capable of entertaining such an idea about him and was perhaps glad of the opportunity of teasing his young friend by reminding him of his inferiority and the great difference between them he found him incredibly inattentive and irritable though he andrey semyonovitch began enlarging on his favourite subject the foundation of a new special commune the brief remarks that dropped from pyotr petrovitch between the clicking of the beads on the reckoning frame betrayed unmistakable and discourteous irony but the humane andrey semyonovitch ascribed pyotr petrovitch s ill humour to his recent breach with dounia and he was burning with impatience to discourse on that theme he had something progressive to say on the subject which might console his worthy friend and could not fail to promote his development there is some sort of festivity being prepared at that at the widow s isn t there pyotr petrovitch asked suddenly interrupting andrey semyonovitch at the most interesting passage why don t you know why i was telling you last night what i think about all such ceremonies and she invited you too i heard you were talking to her yesterday i should never have expected that beggarly fool would have spent on this feast all the money she got from that other fool raskolnikov i was surprised just now as i came through at the preparations there the wines several people are invited it s beyond everything continued pyotr petrovitch who seemed to have some object in pursuing the conversation what you say i am asked too when was that i don t remember but i shan t go why should i i only said a word to her in passing yesterday of the possibility of her obtaining a year s salary as a destitute widow of a government clerk i suppose she has invited me on that account hasn t she he he he i don t intend to go either said lebeziatnikov i should think not after giving her a thrashing you might well hesitate he he who thrashed whom cried lebeziatnikov flustered and blushing why you thrashed katerina ivanovna a month ago i heard so yesterday so that s what your convictions amount to and the woman question too wasn t quite sound he he he and pyotr petrovitch as though comforted went back to clicking his beads it s all slander and nonsense cried lebeziatnikov who was always afraid of allusions to the subject it was not like that at all it was quite different you ve heard it wrong it s a libel i was simply defending myself she rushed at me first with her nails she pulled out all my whiskers it s permissable for anyone i should hope to defend himself and i never allow anyone to use violence to me on principle for it s an act of despotism what was i to do i simply pushed her back he he he luzhin went on laughing maliciously you keep on like that because you are out of humour yourself but that s nonsense and it has nothing nothing whatever to do with the woman question you don t understand i used to think indeed that if women are equal to men in all respects even in strength as is maintained now there ought to be equality in that too of course i reflected afterwards that such a question ought not really to arise for there ought not to be fighting and in the future society fighting is unthinkable and that it would be a queer thing to seek for equality in fighting i am not so stupid though of course there is fighting there won t be later but at present there is confound it how muddled one gets with you it s not on that account that i am not going i am not going on principle not to take part in the revolting convention of memorial dinners that s why though of course one might go to laugh at it i am sorry there won t be any priests at it i should certainly go if there were then you would sit down at another man s table and insult it and those who invited you eh certainly not insult but protest i should do it with a good object i might indirectly assist the cause of enlightenment and propaganda it s a duty of every man to work for enlightenment and propaganda and the more harshly perhaps the better i might drop a seed an idea and something might grow up from that seed how should i be insulting them they might be offended at first but afterwards they d see i d done them a service you know terebyeva who is in the community now was blamed because when she left her family and devoted herself she wrote to her father and mother that she wouldn t go on living conventionally and was entering on a free marriage and it was said that that was too harsh that she might have spared them and have written more kindly i think that s all nonsense and there s no need of softness on the contrary what s wanted is protest varents had been married seven years she abandoned her two children she told her husband straight out in a letter i have realised that i cannot be happy with you i can never forgive you that you have deceived me by concealing from me that there is another organisation of society by means of the communities i have only lately learned it from a great hearted man to whom i have given myself and with whom i am establishing a community i speak plainly because i consider it dishonest to deceive you do as you think best do not hope to get me back you are too late i hope you will be happy that s how letters like that ought to be written is that terebyeva the one you said had made a third free marriage no it s only the second really but what if it were the fourth what if it were the fifteenth that s all nonsense and if ever i regretted the death of my father and mother it is now and i sometimes think if my parents were living what a protest i would have aimed at them i would have done something on purpose i would have shown them i would have astonished them i am really sorry there is no one to surprise he he well be that as you will pyotr petrovitch interrupted but tell me this do you know the dead man s daughter the delicate looking little thing it s true what they say about her isn t it what of it i think that is it is my own personal conviction that this is the normal condition of women why not i mean distinguons in our present society it is not altogether normal because it is compulsory but in the future society it will be perfectly normal because it will be voluntary even as it is she was quite right she was suffering and that was her asset so to speak her capital which she had a perfect right to dispose of of course in the future society there will be no need of assets but her part will have another significance rational and in harmony with her environment as to sofya semyonovna personally i regard her action as a vigorous protest against the organisation of society and i respect her deeply for it i rejoice indeed when i look at her i was told that you got her turned out of these lodgings lebeziatnikov was enraged that s another slander he yelled it was not so at all that was all katerina ivanovna s invention for she did not understand and i never made love to sofya semyonovna i was simply developing her entirely disinterestedly trying to rouse her to protest all i wanted was her protest and sofya semyonovna could not have remained here anyway have you asked her to join your community you keep on laughing and very inappropriately allow me to tell you you don t understand there is no such role in a community the community is established that there should be no such roles in a community such a role is essentially transformed and what is stupid here is sensible there what under present conditions is unnatural becomes perfectly natural in the community it all depends on the environment it s all the environment and man himself is nothing and i am on good terms with sofya semyonovna to this day which is a proof that she never regarded me as having wronged her i am trying now to attract her to the community but on quite quite a different footing what are you laughing at we are trying to establish a community of our own a special one on a broader basis we have gone further in our convictions we reject more and meanwhile i m still developing sofya semyonovna she has a beautiful beautiful character and you take advantage of her fine character eh he he no no oh no on the contrary oh on the contrary he he he a queer thing to say believe me why should i disguise it in fact i feel it strange myself how timid chaste and modern she is with me and you of course are developing her he he trying to prove to her that all that modesty is nonsense not at all not at all how coarsely how stupidly excuse me saying so you misunderstand the word development good heavens how crude you still are we are striving for the freedom of women and you have only one idea in your head setting aside the general question of chastity and feminine modesty as useless in themselves and indeed prejudices i fully accept her chastity with me because that s for her to decide of course if she were to tell me herself that she wanted me i should think myself very lucky because i like the girl very much but as it is no one has ever treated her more courteously than i with more respect for her dignity i wait in hopes that s all you had much better make her a present of something i bet you never thought of that you don t understand as i ve told you already of course she is in such a position but it s another question quite another question you simply despise her seeing a fact which you mistakenly consider deserving of contempt you refuse to take a humane view of a fellow creature you don t know what a character she is i am only sorry that of late she has quite given up reading and borrowing books i used to lend them to her i am sorry too that with all the energy and resolution in protesting which she has already shown once she has little self reliance little so to say independence so as to break free from certain prejudices and certain foolish ideas yet she thoroughly understands some questions for instance about kissing of hands that is that it s an insult to a woman for a man to kiss her hand because it s a sign of inequality we had a debate about it and i described it to her she listened attentively to an account of the workmen s associations in france too now i am explaining the question of coming into the room in the future society and what s that pray we had a debate lately on the question has a member of the community the right to enter another member s room whether man or woman at any time and we decided that he has it might be at an inconvenient moment he he lebeziatnikov was really angry you are always thinking of something unpleasant he cried with aversion tfoo how vexed i am that when i was expounding our system i referred prematurely to the question of personal privacy it s always a stumbling block to people like you they turn it into ridicule before they understand it and how proud they are of it too tfoo i ve often maintained that that question should not be approached by a novice till he has a firm faith in the system and tell me please what do you find so shameful even in cesspools i should be the first to be ready to clean out any cesspool you like and it s not a question of self sacrifice it s simply work honourable useful work which is as good as any other and much better than the work of a raphael and a pushkin because it is more useful and more honourable more honourable he he he what do you mean by more honourable i don t understand such expressions to describe human activity more honourable nobler all those are old fashioned prejudices which i reject everything which is of use to mankind is honourable i only understand one word useful you can snigger as much as you like but that s so pyotr petrovitch laughed heartily he had finished counting the money and was putting it away but some of the notes he left on the table the cesspool question had already been a subject of dispute between them what was absurd was that it made lebeziatnikov really angry while it amused luzhin and at that moment he particularly wanted to anger his young friend it s your ill luck yesterday that makes you so ill humoured and annoying blurted out lebeziatnikov who in spite of his independence and his protests did not venture to oppose pyotr petrovitch and still behaved to him with some of the respect habitual in earlier years you d better tell me this pyotr petrovitch interrupted with haughty displeasure can you or rather are you really friendly enough with that young person to ask her to step in here for a minute i think they ve all come back from the cemetery i heard the sound of steps i want to see her that young person what for lebeziatnikov asked with surprise oh i want to i am leaving here to day or to morrow and therefore i wanted to speak to her about however you may be present during the interview it s better you should be indeed for there s no knowing what you might imagine i shan t imagine anything i only asked and if you ve anything to say to her nothing is easier than to call her in i ll go directly and you may be sure i won t be in your way five minutes later lebeziatnikov came in with sonia she came in very much surprised and overcome with shyness as usual she was always shy in such circumstances and was always afraid of new people she had been as a child and was even more so now pyotr petrovitch met her politely and affably but with a certain shade of bantering familiarity which in his opinion was suitable for a man of his respectability and weight in dealing with a creature so young and so interesting as she he hastened to reassure her and made her sit down facing him at the table sonia sat down looked about her at lebeziatnikov at the notes lying on the table and then again at pyotr petrovitch and her eyes remained riveted on him lebeziatnikov was moving to the door pyotr petrovitch signed to sonia to remain seated and stopped lebeziatnikov is raskolnikov in there has he come he asked him in a whisper raskolnikov yes why yes he is there i saw him just come in why well i particularly beg you to remain here with us and not to leave me alone with this young woman i only want a few words with her but god knows what they may make of it i shouldn t like raskolnikov to repeat anything you understand what i mean i understand lebeziatnikov saw the point yes you are right of course i am convinced personally that you have no reason to be uneasy but still you are right certainly i ll stay i ll stand here at the window and not be in your way i think you are right pyotr petrovitch returned to the sofa sat down opposite sonia looked attentively at her and assumed an extremely dignified even severe expression as much as to say don t you make any mistake madam sonia was overwhelmed with embarrassment in the first place sofya semyonovna will you make my excuses to your respected mamma that s right isn t it katerina ivanovna stands in the place of a mother to you pyotr petrovitch began with great dignity though affably it was evident that his intentions were friendly quite so yes the place of a mother sonia answered timidly and hurriedly then will you make my apologies to her through inevitable circumstances i am forced to be absent and shall not be at the dinner in spite of your mamma s kind invitation yes i ll tell her at once and sonia hastily jumped up from her seat wait that s not all pyotr petrovitch detained her smiling at her simplicity and ignorance of good manners and you know me little my dear sofya semyonovna if you suppose i would have ventured to trouble a person like you for a matter of so little consequence affecting myself only i have another object sonia sat down hurriedly her eyes rested again for an instant on the grey and rainbow coloured notes that remained on the table but she quickly looked away and fixed her eyes on pyotr petrovitch she felt it horribly indecorous especially for her to look at another person s money she stared at the gold eye glass which pyotr petrovitch held in his left hand and at the massive and extremely handsome ring with a yellow stone on his middle finger but suddenly she looked away and not knowing where to turn ended by staring pyotr petrovitch again straight in the face after a pause of still greater dignity he continued i chanced yesterday in passing to exchange a couple of words with katerina ivanovna poor woman that was sufficient to enable me to ascertain that she is in a position preternatural if one may so express it yes preternatural sonia hurriedly assented or it would be simpler and more comprehensible to say ill yes simpler and more comprehen yes ill quite so so then from a feeling of humanity and so to speak compassion i should be glad to be of service to her in any way foreseeing her unfortunate position i believe the whole of this poverty stricken family depends now entirely on you allow me to ask sonia rose to her feet did you say something to her yesterday of the possibility of a pension because she told me you had undertaken to get her one was that true not in the slightest and indeed it s an absurdity i merely hinted at her obtaining temporary assistance as the widow of an official who had died in the service if only she has patronage but apparently your late parent had not served his full term and had not indeed been in the service at all of late in fact if there could be any hope it would be very ephemeral because there would be no claim for assistance in that case far from it and she is dreaming of a pension already he he he a go ahead lady yes she is for she is credulous and good hearted and she believes everything from the goodness of her heart and and and she is like that yes you must excuse her said sonia and again she got up to go but you haven t heard what i have to say no i haven t heard muttered sonia then sit down she was terribly confused she sat down again a third time seeing her position with her unfortunate little ones i should be glad as i have said before so far as lies in my power to be of service that is so far as is in my power not more one might for instance get up a subscription for her or a lottery something of the sort such as is always arranged in such cases by friends or even outsiders desirous of assisting people it was of that i intended to speak to you it might be done yes yes god will repay you for it faltered sonia gazing intently at pyotr petrovitch it might be but we will talk of it later we might begin it to day we will talk it over this evening and lay the foundation so to speak come to me at seven o clock mr lebeziatnikov i hope will assist us but there is one circumstance of which i ought to warn you beforehand and for which i venture to trouble you sofya semyonovna to come here in my opinion money cannot be indeed it s unsafe to put it into katerina ivanovna s own hands the dinner to day is a proof of that though she has not so to speak a crust of bread for to morrow and well boots or shoes or anything she has bought to day jamaica rum and even i believe madeira and and coffee i saw it as i passed through to morrow it will all fall upon you again they won t have a crust of bread it s absurd really and so to my thinking a subscription ought to be raised so that the unhappy widow should not know of the money but only you for instance am i right i don t know this is only to day once in her life she was so anxious to do honour to celebrate the memory and she is very sensible but just as you think and i shall be very very they will all be and god will reward and the orphans sonia burst into tears very well then keep it in mind and now will you accept for the benefit of your relation the small sum that i am able to spare from me personally i am very anxious that my name should not be mentioned in connection with it here having so to speak anxieties of my own i cannot do more and pyotr petrovitch held out to sonia a ten rouble note carefully unfolded sonia took it flushed crimson jumped up muttered something and began taking leave pyotr petrovitch accompanied her ceremoniously to the door she got out of the room at last agitated and distressed and returned to katerina ivanovna overwhelmed with confusion all this time lebeziatnikov had stood at the window or walked about the room anxious not to interrupt the conversation when sonia had gone he walked up to pyotr petrovitch and solemnly held out his hand i heard and saw everything he said laying stress on the last verb that is honourable i mean to say it s humane you wanted to avoid gratitude i saw and although i cannot i confess in principle sympathise with private charity for it not only fails to eradicate the evil but even promotes it yet i must admit that i saw your action with pleasure yes yes i like it that s all nonsense muttered pyotr petrovitch somewhat disconcerted looking carefully at lebeziatnikov no it s not nonsense a man who has suffered distress and annoyance as you did yesterday and who yet can sympathise with the misery of others such a man even though he is making a social mistake is still deserving of respect i did not expect it indeed of you pyotr petrovitch especially as according to your ideas oh what a drawback your ideas are to you how distressed you are for instance by your ill luck yesterday cried the simple hearted lebeziatnikov who felt a return of affection for pyotr petrovitch and what do you want with marriage with legal marriage my dear noble pyotr petrovitch why do you cling to this legality of marriage well you may beat me if you like but i am glad positively glad it hasn t come off that you are free that you are not quite lost for humanity you see i ve spoken my mind because i don t want in your free marriage to be made a fool of and to bring up another man s children that s why i want legal marriage luzhin replied in order to make some answer he seemed preoccupied by something children you referred to children lebeziatnikov started off like a warhorse at the trumpet call children are a social question and a question of first importance i agree but the question of children has another solution some refuse to have children altogether because they suggest the institution of the family we ll speak of children later but now as to the question of honour i confess that s my weak point that horrid military pushkin expression is unthinkable in the dictionary of the future what does it mean indeed it s nonsense there will be no deception in a free marriage that is only the natural consequence of a legal marriage so to say its corrective a protest so that indeed it s not humiliating and if i ever to suppose an absurdity were to be legally married i should be positively glad of it i should say to my wife my dear hitherto i have loved you now i respect you for you ve shown you can protest you laugh that s because you are of incapable of getting away from prejudices confound it all i understand now where the unpleasantness is of being deceived in a legal marriage but it s simply a despicable consequence of a despicable position in which both are humiliated when the deception is open as in a free marriage then it does not exist it s unthinkable your wife will only prove how she respects you by considering you incapable of opposing her happiness and avenging yourself on her for her new husband damn it all i sometimes dream if i were to be married pfoo i mean if i were to marry legally or not it s just the same i should present my wife with a lover if she had not found one for herself my dear i should say i love you but even more than that i desire you to respect me see am i not right pyotr petrovitch sniggered as he listened but without much merriment he hardly heard it indeed he was preoccupied with something else and even lebeziatnikov at last noticed it pyotr petrovitch seemed excited and rubbed his hands lebeziatnikov remembered all this and reflected upon it afterwards chapter ii it would be difficult to explain exactly what could have originated the idea of that senseless dinner in katerina ivanovna s disordered brain nearly ten of the twenty roubles given by raskolnikov for marmeladov s funeral were wasted upon it possibly katerina ivanovna felt obliged to honour the memory of the deceased suitably that all the lodgers and still more amalia ivanovna might know that he was in no way their inferior and perhaps very much their superior and that no one had the right to turn up his nose at him perhaps the chief element was that peculiar poor man s pride which compels many poor people to spend their last savings on some traditional social ceremony simply in order to do like other people and not to be looked down upon it is very probable too that katerina ivanovna longed on this occasion at the moment when she seemed to be abandoned by everyone to show those wretched contemptible lodgers that she knew how to do things how to entertain and that she had been brought up in a genteel she might almost say aristocratic colonel s family and had not been meant for sweeping floors and washing the children s rags at night even the poorest and most broken spirited people are sometimes liable to these paroxysms of pride and vanity which take the form of an irresistible nervous craving and katerina ivanovna was not broken spirited she might have been killed by circumstance but her spirit could not have been broken that is she could not have been intimidated her will could not be crushed moreover sonia had said with good reason that her mind was unhinged she could not be said to be insane but for a year past she had been so harassed that her mind might well be overstrained the later stages of consumption are apt doctors tell us to affect the intellect there was no great variety of wines nor was there madeira but wine there was there was vodka rum and lisbon wine all of the poorest quality but in sufficient quantity besides the traditional rice and honey there were three or four dishes one of which consisted of pancakes all prepared in amalia ivanovna s kitchen two samovars were boiling that tea and punch might be offered after dinner katerina ivanovna had herself seen to purchasing the provisions with the help of one of the lodgers an unfortunate little pole who had somehow been stranded at madame lippevechsel s he promptly put himself at katerina ivanovna s disposal and had been all that morning and all the day before running about as fast as his legs could carry him and very anxious that everyone should be aware of it for every trifle he ran to katerina ivanovna even hunting her out at the bazaar at every instant called her pani she was heartily sick of him before the end though she had declared at first that she could not have got on without this serviceable and magnanimous man it was one of katerina ivanovna s characteristics to paint everyone she met in the most glowing colours her praises were so exaggerated as sometimes to be embarrassing she would invent various circumstances to the credit of her new acquaintance and quite genuinely believe in their reality then all of a sudden she would be disillusioned and would rudely and contemptuously repulse the person she had only a few hours before been literally adoring she was naturally of a gay lively and peace loving disposition but from continual failures and misfortunes she had come to desire so keenly that all should live in peace and joy and should not dare to break the peace that the slightest jar the smallest disaster reduced her almost to frenzy and she would pass in an instant from the brightest hopes and fancies to cursing her fate and raving and knocking her head against the wall amalia ivanovna too suddenly acquired extraordinary importance in katerina ivanovna s eyes and was treated by her with extraordinary respect probably only because amalia ivanovna had thrown herself heart and soul into the preparations she had undertaken to lay the table to provide the linen crockery etc and to cook the dishes in her kitchen and katerina ivanovna had left it all in her hands and gone herself to the cemetery everything had been well done even the table cloth was nearly clean the crockery knives forks and glasses were of course of all shapes and patterns lent by different lodgers but the table was properly laid at the time fixed and amalia ivanovna feeling she had done her work well had put on a black silk dress and a cap with new mourning ribbons and met the returning party with some pride this pride though justifiable displeased katerina ivanovna for some reason as though the table could not have been laid except by amalia ivanovna she disliked the cap with new ribbons too could she be stuck up the stupid german because she was mistress of the house and had consented as a favour to help her poor lodgers as a favour fancy that katerina ivanovna s father who had been a colonel and almost a governor had sometimes had the table set for forty persons and then anyone like amalia ivanovna or rather ludwigovna would not have been allowed into the kitchen katerina ivanovna however put off expressing her feelings for the time and contented herself with treating her coldly though she decided inwardly that she would certainly have to put amalia ivanovna down and set her in her proper place for goodness only knew what she was fancying herself katerina ivanovna was irritated too by the fact that hardly any of the lodgers invited had come to the funeral except the pole who had just managed to run into the cemetery while to the memorial dinner the poorest and most insignificant of them had turned up the wretched creatures many of them not quite sober the older and more respectable of them all as if by common consent stayed away pyotr petrovitch luzhin for instance who might be said to be the most respectable of all the lodgers did not appear though katerina ivanovna had the evening before told all the world that is amalia ivanovna polenka sonia and the pole that he was the most generous noble hearted man with a large property and vast connections who had been a friend of her first husband s and a guest in her father s house and that he had promised to use all his influence to secure her a considerable pension it must be noted that when katerina ivanovna exalted anyone s connections and fortune it was without any ulterior motive quite disinterestedly for the mere pleasure of adding to the consequence of the person praised probably taking his cue from luzhin that contemptible wretch lebeziatnikov had not turned up either what did he fancy himself he was only asked out of kindness and because he was sharing the same room with pyotr petrovitch and was a friend of his so that it would have been awkward not to invite him among those who failed to appear were the genteel lady and her old maidish daughter who had only been lodgers in the house for the last fortnight but had several times complained of the noise and uproar in katerina ivanovna s room especially when marmeladov had come back drunk katerina ivanovna heard this from amalia ivanovna who quarrelling with katerina ivanovna and threatening to turn the whole family out of doors had shouted at her that they were not worth the foot of the honourable lodgers whom they were disturbing katerina ivanovna determined now to invite this lady and her daughter whose foot she was not worth and who had turned away haughtily when she casually met them so that they might know that she was more noble in her thoughts and feelings and did not harbour malice and might see that she was not accustomed to her way of living she had proposed to make this clear to them at dinner with allusions to her late father s governorship and also at the same time to hint that it was exceedingly stupid of them to turn away on meeting her the fat colonel major he was really a discharged officer of low rank was also absent but it appeared that he had been not himself for the last two days the party consisted of the pole a wretched looking clerk with a spotty face and a greasy coat who had not a word to say for himself and smelt abominably a deaf and almost blind old man who had once been in the post office and who had been from immemorial ages maintained by someone at amalia ivanovna s a retired clerk of the commissariat department came too he was drunk had a loud and most unseemly laugh and only fancy was without a waistcoat one of the visitors sat straight down to the table without even greeting katerina ivanovna finally one person having no suit appeared in his dressing gown but this was too much and the efforts of amalia ivanovna and the pole succeeded in removing him the pole brought with him however two other poles who did not live at amalia ivanovna s and whom no one had seen here before all this irritated katerina ivanovna intensely for whom had they made all these preparations then to make room for the visitors the children had not even been laid for at the table but the two little ones were sitting on a bench in the furthest corner with their dinner laid on a box while polenka as a big girl had to look after them feed them and keep their noses wiped like well bred children s katerina ivanovna in fact could hardly help meeting her guests with increased dignity and even haughtiness she stared at some of them with special severity and loftily invited them to take their seats rushing to the conclusion that amalia ivanovna must be responsible for those who were absent she began treating her with extreme nonchalance which the latter promptly observed and resented such a beginning was no good omen for the end all were seated at last raskolnikov came in almost at the moment of their return from the cemetery katerina ivanovna was greatly delighted to see him in the first place because he was the one educated visitor and as everyone knew was in two years to take a professorship in the university and secondly because he immediately and respectfully apologised for having been unable to be at the funeral she positively pounced upon him and made him sit on her left hand amalia ivanovna was on her right in spite of her continual anxiety that the dishes should be passed round correctly and that everyone should taste them in spite of the agonising cough which interrupted her every minute and seemed to have grown worse during the last few days she hastened to pour out in a half whisper to raskolnikov all her suppressed feelings and her just indignation at the failure of the dinner interspersing her remarks with lively and uncontrollable laughter at the expense of her visitors and especially of her landlady it s all that cuckoo s fault you know whom i mean her her katerina ivanovna nodded towards the landlady look at her she s making round eyes she feels that we are talking about her and can t understand pfoo the owl ha ha cough cough cough and what does she put on that cap for cough cough cough have you noticed that she wants everyone to consider that she is patronising me and doing me an honour by being here i asked her like a sensible woman to invite people especially those who knew my late husband and look at the set of fools she has brought the sweeps look at that one with the spotty face and those wretched poles ha ha ha cough cough cough not one of them has ever poked his nose in here i ve never set eyes on them what have they come here for i ask you there they sit in a row hey pan she cried suddenly to one of them have you tasted the pancakes take some more have some beer won t you have some vodka look he s jumped up and is making his bows they must be quite starved poor things never mind let them eat they don t make a noise anyway though i m really afraid for our landlady s silver spoons amalia ivanovna she addressed her suddenly almost aloud if your spoons should happen to be stolen i won t be responsible i warn you ha ha ha she laughed turning to raskolnikov and again nodding towards the landlady in high glee at her sally she didn t understand she didn t understand again look how she sits with her mouth open an owl a real owl an owl in new ribbons ha ha ha here her laugh turned again to an insufferable fit of coughing that lasted five minutes drops of perspiration stood out on her forehead and her handkerchief was stained with blood she showed raskolnikov the blood in silence and as soon as she could get her breath began whispering to him again with extreme animation and a hectic flush on her cheeks do you know i gave her the most delicate instructions so to speak for inviting that lady and her daughter you understand of whom i am speaking it needed the utmost delicacy the greatest nicety but she has managed things so that that fool that conceited baggage that provincial nonentity simply because she is the widow of a major and has come to try and get a pension and to fray out her skirts in the government offices because at fifty she paints her face everybody knows it a creature like that did not think fit to come and has not even answered the invitation which the most ordinary good manners required i can t understand why pyotr petrovitch has not come but where s sonia where has she gone ah there she is at last what is it sonia where have you been it s odd that even at your father s funeral you should be so unpunctual rodion romanovitch make room for her beside you that s your place sonia take what you like have some of the cold entree with jelly that s the best they ll bring the pancakes directly have they given the children some polenka have you got everything cough cough cough that s all right be a good girl lida and kolya don t fidget with your feet sit like a little gentleman what are you saying sonia sonia hastened to give her pyotr petrovitch s apologies trying to speak loud enough for everyone to hear and carefully choosing the most respectful phrases which she attributed to pyotr petrovitch she added that pyotr petrovitch had particularly told her to say that as soon as he possibly could he would come immediately to discuss business alone with her and to consider what could be done for her etc etc sonia knew that this would comfort katerina ivanovna would flatter her and gratify her pride she sat down beside raskolnikov she made him a hurried bow glancing curiously at him but for the rest of the time she seemed to avoid looking at him or speaking to him she seemed absent minded though she kept looking at katerina ivanovna trying to please her neither she nor katerina ivanovna had been able to get mourning sonia was wearing dark brown and katerina ivanovna had on her only dress a dark striped cotton one the message from pyotr petrovitch was very successful listening to sonia with dignity katerina ivanovna inquired with equal dignity how pyotr petrovitch was then at once whispered almost aloud to raskolnikov that it certainly would have been strange for a man of pyotr petrovitch s position and standing to find himself in such extraordinary company in spite of his devotion to her family and his old friendship with her father that s why i am so grateful to you rodion romanovitch that you have not disdained my hospitality even in such surroundings she added almost aloud but i am sure that it was only your special affection for my poor husband that has made you keep your promise then once more with pride and dignity she scanned her visitors and suddenly inquired aloud across the table of the deaf man wouldn t he have some more meat and had he been given some wine the old man made no answer and for a long while could not understand what he was asked though his neighbours amused themselves by poking and shaking him he simply gazed about him with his mouth open which only increased the general mirth what an imbecile look look why was he brought but as to pyotr petrovitch i always had confidence in him katerina ivanovna continued and of course he is not like with an extremely stern face she addressed amalia ivanovna so sharply and loudly that the latter was quite disconcerted not like your dressed up draggletails whom my father would not have taken as cooks into his kitchen and my late husband would have done them honour if he had invited them in the goodness of his heart yes he was fond of drink he was fond of it he did drink cried the commissariat clerk gulping down his twelfth glass of vodka my late husband certainly had that weakness and everyone knows it katerina ivanovna attacked him at once but he was a kind and honourable man who loved and respected his family the worst of it was his good nature made him trust all sorts of disreputable people and he drank with fellows who were not worth the sole of his shoe would you believe it rodion romanovitch they found a gingerbread cock in his pocket he was dead drunk but he did not forget the children a cock did you say a cock shouted the commissariat clerk katerina ivanovna did not vouchsafe a reply she sighed lost in thought no doubt you think like everyone that i was too severe with him she went on addressing raskolnikov but that s not so he respected me he respected me very much he was a kind hearted man and how sorry i was for him sometimes he would sit in a corner and look at me i used to feel so sorry for him i used to want to be kind to him and then would think to myself be kind to him and he will drink again it was only by severity that you could keep him within bounds yes he used to get his hair pulled pretty often roared the commissariat clerk again swallowing another glass of vodka some fools would be the better for a good drubbing as well as having their hair pulled i am not talking of my late husband now katerina ivanovna snapped at him the flush on her cheeks grew more and more marked her chest heaved in another minute she would have been ready to make a scene many of the visitors were sniggering evidently delighted they began poking the commissariat clerk and whispering something to him they were evidently trying to egg him on allow me to ask what are you alluding to began the clerk that is to say whose about whom did you say just now but i don t care that s nonsense widow i forgive you pass and he took another drink of vodka raskolnikov sat in silence listening with disgust he only ate from politeness just tasting the food that katerina ivanovna was continually putting on his plate to avoid hurting her feelings he watched sonia intently but sonia became more and more anxious and distressed she too foresaw that the dinner would not end peaceably and saw with terror katerina ivanovna s growing irritation she knew that she sonia was the chief reason for the genteel ladies contemptuous treatment of katerina ivanovna s invitation she had heard from amalia ivanovna that the mother was positively offended at the invitation and had asked the question how could she let her daughter sit down beside that young person sonia had a feeling that katerina ivanovna had already heard this and an insult to sonia meant more to katerina ivanovna than an insult to herself her children or her father sonia knew that katerina ivanovna would not be satisfied now till she had shown those draggletails that they were both to make matters worse someone passed sonia from the other end of the table a plate with two hearts pierced with an arrow cut out of black bread katerina ivanovna flushed crimson and at once said aloud across the table that the man who sent it was a drunken ass amalia ivanovna was foreseeing something amiss and at the same time deeply wounded by katerina ivanovna s haughtiness and to restore the good humour of the company and raise herself in their esteem she began apropos of nothing telling a story about an acquaintance of hers karl from the chemist s who was driving one night in a cab and that the cabman wanted him to kill and karl very much begged him not to kill and wept and clasped hands and frightened and from fear pierced his heart though katerina ivanovna smiled she observed at once that amalia ivanovna ought not to tell anecdotes in russian the latter was still more offended and she retorted that her vater aus berlin was a very important man and always went with his hands in pockets katerina ivanovna could not restrain herself and laughed so much that amalia ivanovna lost patience and could scarcely control herself listen to the owl katerina ivanovna whispered at once her good humour almost restored she meant to say he kept his hands in his pockets but she said he put his hands in people s pockets cough cough and have you noticed rodion romanovitch that all these petersburg foreigners the germans especially are all stupider than we can you fancy anyone of us telling how karl from the chemist s pierced his heart from fear and that the idiot instead of punishing the cabman clasped his hands and wept and much begged ah the fool and you know she fancies it s very touching and does not suspect how stupid she is to my thinking that drunken commissariat clerk is a great deal cleverer anyway one can see that he has addled his brains with drink but you know these foreigners are always so well behaved and serious look how she sits glaring she is angry ha ha cough cough cough regaining her good humour katerina ivanovna began at once telling raskolnikov that when she had obtained her pension she intended to open a school for the daughters of gentlemen in her native town t this was the first time she had spoken to him of the project and she launched out into the most alluring details it suddenly appeared that katerina ivanovna had in her hands the very certificate of honour of which marmeladov had spoken to raskolnikov in the tavern when he told him that katerina ivanovna his wife had danced the shawl dance before the governor and other great personages on leaving school this certificate of honour was obviously intended now to prove katerina ivanovna s right to open a boarding school but she had armed herself with it chiefly with the object of overwhelming those two stuck up draggletails if they came to the dinner and proving incontestably that katerina ivanovna was of the most noble she might even say aristocratic family a colonel s daughter and was far superior to certain adventuresses who have been so much to the fore of late the certificate of honour immediately passed into the hands of the drunken guests and katerina ivanovna did not try to retain it for it actually contained the statement en toutes lettres that her father was of the rank of a major and also a companion of an order so that she really was almost the daughter of a colonel warming up katerina ivanovna proceeded to enlarge on the peaceful and happy life they would lead in t on the gymnasium teachers whom she would engage to give lessons in her boarding school one a most respectable old frenchman one mangot who had taught katerina ivanovna herself in old days and was still living in t and would no doubt teach in her school on moderate terms next she spoke of sonia who would go with her to t and help her in all her plans at this someone at the further end of the table gave a sudden guffaw though katerina ivanovna tried to appear to be disdainfully unaware of it she raised her voice and began at once speaking with conviction of sonia s undoubted ability to assist her of her gentleness patience devotion generosity and good education tapping sonia on the cheek and kissing her warmly twice sonia flushed crimson and katerina ivanovna suddenly burst into tears immediately observing that she was nervous and silly that she was too much upset that it was time to finish and as the dinner was over it was time to hand round the tea at that moment amalia ivanovna deeply aggrieved at taking no part in the conversation and not being listened to made one last effort and with secret misgivings ventured on an exceedingly deep and weighty observation that in the future boarding school she would have to pay particular attention to die wasche and that there certainly must be a good dame to look after the linen and secondly that the young ladies must not novels at night read katerina ivanovna who certainly was upset and very tired as well as heartily sick of the dinner at once cut short amalia ivanovna saying she knew nothing about it and was talking nonsense that it was the business of the laundry maid and not of the directress of a high class boarding school to look after die wasche and as for novel reading that was simply rudeness and she begged her to be silent amalia ivanovna fired up and getting angry observed that she only meant her good and that she had meant her very good and that it was long since she had paid her gold for the lodgings katerina ivanovna at once set her down saying that it was a lie to say she wished her good because only yesterday when her dead husband was lying on the table she had worried her about the lodgings to this amalia ivanovna very appropriately observed that she had invited those ladies but those ladies had not come because those ladies are ladies and cannot come to a lady who is not a lady katerina ivanovna at once pointed out to her that as she was a slut she could not judge what made one really a lady amalia ivanovna at once declared that her vater aus berlin was a very very important man and both hands in pockets went and always used to say poof poof and she leapt up from the table to represent her father sticking her hands in her pockets puffing her cheeks and uttering vague sounds resembling poof poof amid loud laughter from all the lodgers who purposely encouraged amalia ivanovna hoping for a fight but this was too much for katerina ivanovna and she at once declared so that all could hear that amalia ivanovna probably never had a father but was simply a drunken petersburg finn and had certainly once been a cook and probably something worse amalia ivanovna turned as red as a lobster and squealed that perhaps katerina ivanovna never had a father but she had a vater aus berlin and that he wore a long coat and always said poof poof poof katerina ivanovna observed contemptuously that all knew what her family was and that on that very certificate of honour it was stated in print that her father was a colonel while amalia ivanovna s father if she really had one was probably some finnish milkman but that probably she never had a father at all since it was still uncertain whether her name was amalia ivanovna or amalia ludwigovna at this amalia ivanovna lashed to fury struck the table with her fist and shrieked that she was amalia ivanovna and not ludwigovna that her vater was named johann and that he was a burgomeister and that katerina ivanovna s vater was quite never a burgomeister katerina ivanovna rose from her chair and with a stern and apparently calm voice though she was pale and her chest was heaving observed that if she dared for one moment to set her contemptible wretch of a father on a level with her papa she katerina ivanovna would tear her cap off her head and trample it under foot amalia ivanovna ran about the room shouting at the top of her voice that she was mistress of the house and that katerina ivanovna should leave the lodgings that minute then she rushed for some reason to collect the silver spoons from the table there was a great outcry and uproar the children began crying sonia ran to restrain katerina ivanovna but when amalia ivanovna shouted something about the yellow ticket katerina ivanovna pushed sonia away and rushed at the landlady to carry out her threat at that minute the door opened and pyotr petrovitch luzhin appeared on the threshold he stood scanning the party with severe and vigilant eyes katerina ivanovna rushed to him chapter iii pyotr petrovitch she cried protect me you at least make this foolish woman understand that she can t behave like this to a lady in misfortune that there is a law for such things i ll go to the governor general himself she shall answer for it remembering my father s hospitality protect these orphans allow me madam allow me pyotr petrovitch waved her off your papa as you are well aware i had not the honour of knowing someone laughed aloud and i do not intend to take part in your everlasting squabbles with amalia ivanovna i have come here to speak of my own affairs and i want to have a word with your stepdaughter sofya ivanovna i think it is allow me to pass pyotr petrovitch edging by her went to the opposite corner where sonia was katerina ivanovna remained standing where she was as though thunderstruck she could not understand how pyotr petrovitch could deny having enjoyed her father s hospitility though she had invented it herself she believed in it firmly by this time she was struck too by the businesslike dry and even contemptuous menacing tone of pyotr petrovitch all the clamour gradually died away at his entrance not only was this serious business man strikingly incongruous with the rest of the party but it was evident too that he had come upon some matter of consequence that some exceptional cause must have brought him and that therefore something was going to happen raskolnikov standing beside sonia moved aside to let him pass pyotr petrovitch did not seem to notice him a minute later lebeziatnikov too appeared in the doorway he did not come in but stood still listening with marked interest almost wonder and seemed for a time perplexed excuse me for possibly interrupting you but it s a matter of some importance pyotr petrovitch observed addressing the company generally i am glad indeed to find other persons present amalia ivanovna i humbly beg you as mistress of the house to pay careful attention to what i have to say to sofya ivanovna sofya ivanovna he went on addressing sonia who was very much surprised and already alarmed immediately after your visit i found that a hundred rouble note was missing from my table in the room of my friend mr lebeziatnikov if in any way whatever you know and will tell us where it is now i assure you on my word of honour and call all present to witness that the matter shall end there in the opposite case i shall be compelled to have recourse to very serious measures and then you must blame yourself complete silence reigned in the room even the crying children were still sonia stood deadly pale staring at luzhin and unable to say a word she seemed not to understand some seconds passed well how is it to be then asked luzhin looking intently at her i don t know i know nothing about it sonia articulated faintly at last no you know nothing luzhin repeated and again he paused for some seconds think a moment mademoiselle he began severely but still as it were admonishing her reflect i am prepared to give you time for consideration kindly observe this if i were not so entirely convinced i should not you may be sure with my experience venture to accuse you so directly seeing that for such direct accusation before witnesses if false or even mistaken i should myself in a certain sense be made responsible i am aware of that this morning i changed for my own purposes several five per cent securities for the sum of approximately three thousand roubles the account is noted down in my pocket book on my return home i proceeded to count the money as mr lebeziatnikov will bear witness and after counting two thousand three hundred roubles i put the rest in my pocket book in my coat pocket about five hundred roubles remained on the table and among them three notes of a hundred roubles each at that moment you entered at my invitation and all the time you were present you were exceedingly embarrassed so that three times you jumped up in the middle of the conversation and tried to make off mr lebeziatnikov can bear witness to this you yourself mademoiselle probably will not refuse to confirm my statement that i invited you through mr lebeziatnikov solely in order to discuss with you the hopeless and destitute position of your relative katerina ivanovna whose dinner i was unable to attend and the advisability of getting up something of the nature of a subscription lottery or the like for her benefit you thanked me and even shed tears i describe all this as it took place primarily to recall it to your mind and secondly to show you that not the slightest detail has escaped my recollection then i took a ten rouble note from the table and handed it to you by way of first instalment on my part for the benefit of your relative mr lebeziatnikov saw all this then i accompanied you to the door you being still in the same state of embarrassment after which being left alone with mr lebeziatnikov i talked to him for ten minutes then mr lebeziatnikov went out and i returned to the table with the money lying on it intending to count it and to put it aside as i proposed doing before to my surprise one hundred rouble note had disappeared kindly consider the position mr lebeziatnikov i cannot suspect i am ashamed to allude to such a supposition i cannot have made a mistake in my reckoning for the minute before your entrance i had finished my accounts and found the total correct you will admit that recollecting your embarrassment your eagerness to get away and the fact that you kept your hands for some time on the table and taking into consideration your social position and the habits associated with it i was so to say with horror and positively against my will compelled to entertain a suspicion a cruel but justifiable suspicion i will add further and repeat that in spite of my positive conviction i realise that i run a certain risk in making this accusation but as you see i could not let it pass i have taken action and i will tell you why solely madam solely owing to your black ingratitude why i invite you for the benefit of your destitute relative i present you with my donation of ten roubles and you on the spot repay me for all that with such an action it is too bad you need a lesson reflect moreover like a true friend i beg you and you could have no better friend at this moment think what you are doing otherwise i shall be immovable well what do you say i have taken nothing sonia whispered in terror you gave me ten roubles here it is take it sonia pulled her handkerchief out of her pocket untied a corner of it took out the ten rouble note and gave it to luzhin and the hundred roubles you do not confess to taking he insisted reproachfully not taking the note sonia looked about her all were looking at her with such awful stern ironical hostile eyes she looked at raskolnikov he stood against the wall with his arms crossed looking at her with glowing eyes good god broke from sonia amalia ivanovna we shall have to send word to the police and therefore i humbly beg you meanwhile to send for the house porter luzhin said softly and even kindly gott der barmherzige i knew she was the thief cried amalia ivanovna throwing up her hands you knew it luzhin caught her up then i suppose you had some reason before this for thinking so i beg you worthy amalia ivanovna to remember your words which have been uttered before witnesses there was a buzz of loud conversation on all sides all were in movement what cried katerina ivanovna suddenly realising the position and she rushed at luzhin what you accuse her of stealing sonia ah the wretches the wretches and running to sonia she flung her wasted arms round her and held her as in a vise sonia how dared you take ten roubles from him foolish girl give it to me give me the ten roubles at once here and snatching the note from sonia katerina ivanovna crumpled it up and flung it straight into luzhin s face it hit him in the eye and fell on the ground amalia ivanovna hastened to pick it up pyotr petrovitch lost his temper hold that mad woman he shouted at that moment several other persons besides lebeziatnikov appeared in the doorway among them the two ladies what mad am i mad idiot shrieked katerina ivanovna you are an idiot yourself pettifogging lawyer base man sonia sonia take his money sonia a thief why she d give away her last penny and katerina ivanovna broke into hysterical laughter did you ever see such an idiot she turned from side to side and you too she suddenly saw the landlady and you too sausage eater you declare that she is a thief you trashy prussian hen s leg in a crinoline she hasn t been out of this room she came straight from you you wretch and sat down beside me everyone saw her she sat here by rodion romanovitch search her since she s not left the room the money would have to be on her search her search her but if you don t find it then excuse me my dear fellow you ll answer for it i ll go to our sovereign to our sovereign to our gracious tsar himself and throw myself at his feet to day this minute i am alone in the world they would let me in do you think they wouldn t you re wrong i will get in i will get in you reckoned on her meekness you relied upon that but i am not so submissive let me tell you you ve gone too far yourself search her search her and katerina ivanovna in a frenzy shook luzhin and dragged him towards sonia i am ready i ll be responsible but calm yourself madam calm yourself i see that you are not so submissive well well but as to that luzhin muttered that ought to be before the police though indeed there are witnesses enough as it is i am ready but in any case it s difficult for a man on account of her sex but with the help of amalia ivanovna though of course it s not the way to do things how is it to be done as you will let anyone who likes search her cried katerina ivanovna sonia turn out your pockets see look monster the pocket is empty here was her handkerchief here is the other pocket look d you see d you see and katerina ivanovna turned or rather snatched both pockets inside out but from the right pocket a piece of paper flew out and describing a parabola in the air fell at luzhin s feet everyone saw it several cried out pyotr petrovitch stooped down picked up the paper in two fingers lifted it where all could see it and opened it it was a hundred rouble note folded in eight pyotr petrovitch held up the note showing it to everyone thief out of my lodging police police yelled amalia ivanovna they must to siberia be sent away exclamations arose on all sides raskolnikov was silent keeping his eyes fixed on sonia except for an occasional rapid glance at luzhin sonia stood still as though unconscious she was hardly able to feel surprise suddenly the colour rushed to her cheeks she uttered a cry and hid her face in her hands no it wasn t i i didn t take it i know nothing about it she cried with a heartrending wail and she ran to katerina ivanovna who clasped her tightly in her arms as though she would shelter her from all the world sonia sonia i don t believe it you see i don t believe it she cried in the face of the obvious fact swaying her to and fro in her arms like a baby kissing her face continually then snatching at her hands and kissing them too you took it how stupid these people are oh dear you are fools fools she cried addressing the whole room you don t know you don t know what a heart she has what a girl she is she take it she she d sell her last rag she d go barefoot to help you if you needed it that s what she is she has the yellow passport because my children were starving she sold herself for us ah husband husband do you see do you see what a memorial dinner for you merciful heavens defend her why are you all standing still rodion romanovitch why don t you stand up for her do you believe it too you are not worth her little finger all of you together good god defend her now at least the wail of the poor consumptive helpless woman seemed to produce a great effect on her audience the agonised wasted consumptive face the parched blood stained lips the hoarse voice the tears unrestrained as a child s the trustful childish and yet despairing prayer for help were so piteous that everyone seemed to feel for her pyotr petrovitch at any rate was at once moved to compassion madam madam this incident does not reflect upon you he cried impressively no one would take upon himself to accuse you of being an instigator or even an accomplice in it especially as you have proved her guilt by turning out her pockets showing that you had no previous idea of it i am most ready most ready to show compassion if poverty so to speak drove sofya semyonovna to it but why did you refuse to confess mademoiselle were you afraid of the disgrace the first step you lost your head perhaps one can quite understand it but how could you have lowered yourself to such an action gentlemen he addressed the whole company gentlemen compassionate and so to say commiserating these people i am ready to overlook it even now in spite of the personal insult lavished upon me and may this disgrace be a lesson to you for the future he said addressing sonia and i will carry the matter no further enough pyotr petrovitch stole a glance at raskolnikov their eyes met and the fire in raskolnikov s seemed ready to reduce him to ashes meanwhile katerina ivanovna apparently heard nothing she was kissing and hugging sonia like a madwoman the children too were embracing sonia on all sides and polenka though she did not fully understand what was wrong was drowned in tears and shaking with sobs as she hid her pretty little face swollen with weeping on sonia s shoulder how vile a loud voice cried suddenly in the doorway pyotr petrovitch looked round quickly what vileness lebeziatnikov repeated staring him straight in the face pyotr petrovitch gave a positive start all noticed it and recalled it afterwards lebeziatnikov strode into the room and you dared to call me as witness he said going up to pyotr petrovitch what do you mean what are you talking about muttered luzhin i mean that you are a slanderer that s what my words mean lebeziatnikov said hotly looking sternly at him with his short sighted eyes he was extremely angry raskolnikov gazed intently at him as though seizing and weighing each word again there was a silence pyotr petrovitch indeed seemed almost dumbfounded for the first moment if you mean that for me he began stammering but what s the matter with you are you out of your mind i m in my mind but you are a scoundrel ah how vile i have heard everything i kept waiting on purpose to understand it for i must own even now it is not quite logical what you have done it all for i can t understand why what have i done then give over talking in your nonsensical riddles or maybe you are drunk you may be a drunkard perhaps vile man but i am not i never touch vodka for it s against my convictions would you believe it he he himself with his own hands gave sofya semyonovna that hundred rouble note i saw it i was a witness i ll take my oath he did it he repeated lebeziatnikov addressing all are you crazy milksop squealed luzhin she is herself before you she herself here declared just now before everyone that i gave her only ten roubles how could i have given it to her i saw it i saw it lebeziatnikov repeated and though it is against my principles i am ready this very minute to take any oath you like before the court for i saw how you slipped it in her pocket only like a fool i thought you did it out of kindness when you were saying good bye to her at the door while you held her hand in one hand with the other the left you slipped the note into her pocket i saw it i saw it luzhin turned pale what lies he cried impudently why how could you standing by the window see the note you fancied it with your short sighted eyes you are raving no i didn t fancy it and though i was standing some way off i saw it all and though it certainly would be hard to distinguish a note from the window that s true i knew for certain that it was a hundred rouble note because when you were going to give sofya semyonovna ten roubles you took up from the table a hundred rouble note i saw it because i was standing near then and an idea struck me at once so that i did not forget you had it in your hand you folded it and kept it in your hand all the time i didn t think of it again until when you were getting up you changed it from your right hand to your left and nearly dropped it i noticed it because the same idea struck me again that you meant to do her a kindness without my seeing you can fancy how i watched you and i saw how you succeeded in slipping it into her pocket i saw it i saw it i ll take my oath lebeziatnikov was almost breathless exclamations arose on all hands chiefly expressive of wonder but some were menacing in tone they all crowded round pyotr petrovitch katerina ivanovna flew to lebeziatnikov i was mistaken in you protect her you are the only one to take her part she is an orphan god has sent you katerina ivanovna hardly knowing what she was doing sank on her knees before him a pack of nonsense yelled luzhin roused to fury it s all nonsense you ve been talking an idea struck you you didn t think you noticed what does it amount to so i gave it to her on the sly on purpose what for with what object what have i to do with this what for that s what i can t understand but that what i am telling you is the fact that s certain so far from my being mistaken you infamous criminal man i remember how on account of it a question occurred to me at once just when i was thanking you and pressing your hand what made you put it secretly in her pocket why you did it secretly i mean could it be simply to conceal it from me knowing that my convictions are opposed to yours and that i do not approve of private benevolence which effects no radical cure well i decided that you really were ashamed of giving such a large sum before me perhaps too i thought he wants to give her a surprise when she finds a whole hundred rouble note in her pocket for i know some benevolent people are very fond of decking out their charitable actions in that way then the idea struck me too that you wanted to test her to see whether when she found it she would come to thank you then too that you wanted to avoid thanks and that as the saying is your right hand should not know something of that sort in fact i thought of so many possibilities that i put off considering it but still thought it indelicate to show you that i knew your secret but another idea struck me again that sofya semyonovna might easily lose the money before she noticed it that was why i decided to come in here to call her out of the room and to tell her that you put a hundred roubles in her pocket but on my way i went first to madame kobilatnikov s to take them the general treatise on the positive method and especially to recommend piderit s article and also wagner s then i come on here and what a state of things i find now could i could i have all these ideas and reflections if i had not seen you put the hundred rouble note in her pocket when lebeziatnikov finished his long winded harangue with the logical deduction at the end he was quite tired and the perspiration streamed from his face he could not alas even express himself correctly in russian though he knew no other language so that he was quite exhausted almost emaciated after this heroic exploit but his speech produced a powerful effect he had spoken with such vehemence with such conviction that everyone obviously believed him pyotr petrovitch felt that things were going badly with him what is it to do with me if silly ideas did occur to you he shouted that s no evidence you may have dreamt it that s all and i tell you you are lying sir you are lying and slandering from some spite against me simply from pique because i did not agree with your free thinking godless social propositions but this retort did not benefit pyotr petrovitch murmurs of disapproval were heard on all sides ah that s your line now is it cried lebeziatnikov that s nonsense call the police and i ll take my oath there s only one thing i can t understand what made him risk such a contemptible action oh pitiful despicable man i can explain why he risked such an action and if necessary i too will swear to it raskolnikov said at last in a firm voice and he stepped forward he appeared to be firm and composed everyone felt clearly from the very look of him that he really knew about it and that the mystery would be solved now i can explain it all to myself said raskolnikov addressing lebeziatnikov from the very beginning of the business i suspected that there was some scoundrelly intrigue at the bottom of it i began to suspect it from some special circumstances known to me only which i will explain at once to everyone they account for everything your valuable evidence has finally made everything clear to me i beg all all to listen this gentleman he pointed to luzhin was recently engaged to be married to a young lady my sister avdotya romanovna raskolnikov but coming to petersburg he quarrelled with me the day before yesterday at our first meeting and i drove him out of my room i have two witnesses to prove it he is a very spiteful man the day before yesterday i did not know that he was staying here in your room and that consequently on the very day we quarrelled the day before yesterday he saw me give katerina ivanovna some money for the funeral as a friend of the late mr marmeladov he at once wrote a note to my mother and informed her that i had given away all my money not to katerina ivanovna but to sofya semyonovna and referred in a most contemptible way to the character of sofya semyonovna that is hinted at the character of my attitude to sofya semyonovna all this you understand was with the object of dividing me from my mother and sister by insinuating that i was squandering on unworthy objects the money which they had sent me and which was all they had yesterday evening before my mother and sister and in his presence i declared that i had given the money to katerina ivanovna for the funeral and not to sofya semyonovna and that i had no acquaintance with sofya semyonovna and had never seen her before indeed at the same time i added that he pyotr petrovitch luzhin with all his virtues was not worth sofya semyonovna s little finger though he spoke so ill of her to his question would i let sofya semyonovna sit down beside my sister i answered that i had already done so that day irritated that my mother and sister were unwilling to quarrel with me at his insinuations he gradually began being unpardonably rude to them a final rupture took place and he was turned out of the house all this happened yesterday evening now i beg your special attention consider if he had now succeeded in proving that sofya semyonovna was a thief he would have shown to my mother and sister that he was almost right in his suspicions that he had reason to be angry at my putting my sister on a level with sofya semyonovna that in attacking me he was protecting and preserving the honour of my sister his betrothed in fact he might even through all this have been able to estrange me from my family and no doubt he hoped to be restored to favour with them to say nothing of revenging himself on me personally for he has grounds for supposing that the honour and happiness of sofya semyonovna are very precious to me that was what he was working for that s how i understand it that s the whole reason for it and there can be no other it was like this or somewhat like this that raskolnikov wound up his speech which was followed very attentively though often interrupted by exclamations from his audience but in spite of interruptions he spoke clearly calmly exactly firmly his decisive voice his tone of conviction and his stern face made a great impression on everyone yes yes that s it lebeziatnikov assented gleefully that must be it for he asked me as soon as sofya semyonovna came into our room whether you were here whether i had seen you among katerina ivanovna s guests he called me aside to the window and asked me in secret it was essential for him that you should be here that s it that s it luzhin smiled contemptuously and did not speak but he was very pale he seemed to be deliberating on some means of escape perhaps he would have been glad to give up everything and get away but at the moment this was scarcely possible it would have implied admitting the truth of the accusations brought against him moreover the company which had already been excited by drink was now too much stirred to allow it the commissariat clerk though indeed he had not grasped the whole position was shouting louder than anyone and was making some suggestions very unpleasant to luzhin but not all those present were drunk lodgers came in from all the rooms the three poles were tremendously excited and were continually shouting at him the pan is a lajdak and muttering threats in polish sonia had been listening with strained attention though she too seemed unable to grasp it all she seemed as though she had just returned to consciousness she did not take her eyes off raskolnikov feeling that all her safety lay in him katerina ivanovna breathed hard and painfully and seemed fearfully exhausted amalia ivanovna stood looking more stupid than anyone with her mouth wide open unable to make out what had happened she only saw that pyotr petrovitch had somehow come to grief raskolnikov was attempting to speak again but they did not let him everyone was crowding round luzhin with threats and shouts of abuse but pyotr petrovitch was not intimidated seeing that his accusation of sonia had completely failed he had recourse to insolence allow me gentlemen allow me don t squeeze let me pass he said making his way through the crowd and no threats if you please i assure you it will be useless you will gain nothing by it on the contrary you ll have to answer gentlemen for violently obstructing the course of justice the thief has been more than unmasked and i shall prosecute our judges are not so blind and not so drunk and will not believe the testimony of two notorious infidels agitators and atheists who accuse me from motives of personal revenge which they are foolish enough to admit yes allow me to pass don t let me find a trace of you in my room kindly leave at once and everything is at an end between us when i think of the trouble i ve been taking the way i ve been expounding all this fortnight i told you myself to day that i was going when you tried to keep me now i will simply add that you are a fool i advise you to see a doctor for your brains and your short sight let me pass gentlemen he forced his way through but the commissariat clerk was unwilling to let him off so easily he picked up a glass from the table brandished it in the air and flung it at pyotr petrovitch but the glass flew straight at amalia ivanovna she screamed and the clerk overbalancing fell heavily under the table pyotr petrovitch made his way to his room and half an hour later had left the house sonia timid by nature had felt before that day that she could be ill treated more easily than anyone and that she could be wronged with impunity yet till that moment she had fancied that she might escape misfortune by care gentleness and submissiveness before everyone her disappointment was too great she could of course bear with patience and almost without murmur anything even this but for the first minute she felt it too bitter in spite of her triumph and her justification when her first terror and stupefaction had passed and she could understand it all clearly the feeling of her helplessness and of the wrong done to her made her heart throb with anguish and she was overcome with hysterical weeping at last unable to bear any more she rushed out of the room and ran home almost immediately after luzhin s departure when amidst loud laughter the glass flew at amalia ivanovna it was more than the landlady could endure with a shriek she rushed like a fury at katerina ivanovna considering her to blame for everything out of my lodgings at once quick march and with these words she began snatching up everything she could lay her hands on that belonged to katerina ivanovna and throwing it on the floor katerina ivanovna pale almost fainting and gasping for breath jumped up from the bed where she had sunk in exhaustion and darted at amalia ivanovna but the battle was too unequal the landlady waved her away like a feather what as though that godless calumny was not enough this vile creature attacks me what on the day of my husband s funeral i am turned out of my lodging after eating my bread and salt she turns me into the street with my orphans where am i to go wailed the poor woman sobbing and gasping good god she cried with flashing eyes is there no justice upon earth whom should you protect if not us orphans we shall see there is law and justice on earth there is i will find it wait a bit godless creature polenka stay with the children i ll come back wait for me if you have to wait in the street we will see whether there is justice on earth and throwing over her head that green shawl which marmeladov had mentioned to raskolnikov katerina ivanovna squeezed her way through the disorderly and drunken crowd of lodgers who still filled the room and wailing and tearful she ran into the street with a vague intention of going at once somewhere to find justice polenka with the two little ones in her arms crouched terrified on the trunk in the corner of the room where she waited trembling for her mother to come back amalia ivanovna raged about the room shrieking lamenting and throwing everything she came across on the floor the lodgers talked incoherently some commented to the best of their ability on what had happened others quarrelled and swore at one another while others struck up a song now it s time for me to go thought raskolnikov well sofya semyonovna we shall see what you ll say now and he set off in the direction of sonia s lodgings chapter iv raskolnikov had been a vigorous and active champion of sonia against luzhin although he had such a load of horror and anguish in his own heart but having gone through so much in the morning he found a sort of relief in a change of sensations apart from the strong personal feeling which impelled him to defend sonia he was agitated too especially at some moments by the thought of his approaching interview with sonia he had to tell her who had killed lizaveta he knew the terrible suffering it would be to him and as it were brushed away the thought of it so when he cried as he left katerina ivanovna s well sofya semyonovna we shall see what you ll say now he was still superficially excited still vigorous and defiant from his triumph over luzhin but strange to say by the time he reached sonia s lodging he felt a sudden impotence and fear he stood still in hesitation at the door asking himself the strange question must he tell her who killed lizaveta it was a strange question because he felt at the very time not only that he could not help telling her but also that he could not put off the telling he did not yet know why it must be so he only felt it and the agonising sense of his impotence before the inevitable almost crushed him to cut short his hesitation and suffering he quickly opened the door and looked at sonia from the doorway she was sitting with her elbows on the table and her face in her hands but seeing raskolnikov she got up at once and came to meet him as though she were expecting him what would have become of me but for you she said quickly meeting him in the middle of the room evidently she was in haste to say this to him it was what she had been waiting for raskolnikov went to the table and sat down on the chair from which she had only just risen she stood facing him two steps away just as she had done the day before well sonia he said and felt that his voice was trembling it was all due to your social position and the habits associated with it did you understand that just now her face showed her distress only don t talk to me as you did yesterday she interrupted him please don t begin it there is misery enough without that she made haste to smile afraid that he might not like the reproach i was silly to come away from there what is happening there now i wanted to go back directly but i kept thinking that you would come he told her that amalia ivanovna was turning them out of their lodging and that katerina ivanovna had run off somewhere to seek justice my god cried sonia let s go at once and she snatched up her cape it s everlastingly the same thing said raskolnikov irritably you ve no thought except for them stay a little with me but katerina ivanovna you won t lose katerina ivanovna you may be sure she ll come to you herself since she has run out he added peevishly if she doesn t find you here you ll be blamed for it sonia sat down in painful suspense raskolnikov was silent gazing at the floor and deliberating this time luzhin did not want to prosecute you he began not looking at sonia but if he had wanted to if it had suited his plans he would have sent you to prison if it had not been for lebeziatnikov and me ah yes she assented in a faint voice yes she repeated preoccupied and distressed but i might easily not have been there and it was quite an accident lebeziatnikov s turning up sonia was silent and if you d gone to prison what then do you remember what i said yesterday again she did not answer he waited i thought you would cry out again don t speak of it leave off raskolnikov gave a laugh but rather a forced one what silence again he asked a minute later we must talk about something you know it would be interesting for me to know how you would decide a certain problem as lebeziatnikov would say he was beginning to lose the thread no really i am serious imagine sonia that you had known all luzhin s intentions beforehand known that is for a fact that they would be the ruin of katerina ivanovna and the children and yourself thrown in since you don t count yourself for anything polenka too for she ll go the same way well if suddenly it all depended on your decision whether he or they should go on living that is whether luzhin should go on living and doing wicked things or katerina ivanovna should die how would you decide which of them was to die i ask you sonia looked uneasily at him there was something peculiar in this hesitating question which seemed approaching something in a roundabout way i felt that you were going to ask some question like that she said looking inquisitively at him i dare say you did but how is it to be answered why do you ask about what could not happen said sonia reluctantly then it would be better for luzhin to go on living and doing wicked things you haven t dared to decide even that but i can t know the divine providence and why do you ask what can t be answered what s the use of such foolish questions how could it happen that it should depend on my decision who has made me a judge to decide who is to live and who is not to live oh if the divine providence is to be mixed up in it there is no doing anything raskolnikov grumbled morosely you d better say straight out what you want sonia cried in distress you are leading up to something again can you have come simply to torture me she could not control herself and began crying bitterly he looked at her in gloomy misery five minutes passed of course you re right sonia he said softly at last he was suddenly changed his tone of assumed arrogance and helpless defiance was gone even his voice was suddenly weak i told you yesterday that i was not coming to ask forgiveness and almost the first thing i ve said is to ask forgiveness i said that about luzhin and providence for my own sake i was asking forgiveness sonia he tried to smile but there was something helpless and incomplete in his pale smile he bowed his head and hid his face in his hands and suddenly a strange surprising sensation of a sort of bitter hatred for sonia passed through his heart as it were wondering and frightened of this sensation he raised his head and looked intently at her but he met her uneasy and painfully anxious eyes fixed on him there was love in them his hatred vanished like a phantom it was not the real feeling he had taken the one feeling for the other it only meant that that minute had come he hid his face in his hands again and bowed his head suddenly he turned pale got up from his chair looked at sonia and without uttering a word sat down mechanically on her bed his sensations that moment were terribly like the moment when he had stood over the old woman with the axe in his hand and felt that he must not lose another minute what s the matter asked sonia dreadfully frightened he could not utter a word this was not at all not at all the way he had intended to tell and he did not understand what was happening to him now she went up to him softly sat down on the bed beside him and waited not taking her eyes off him her heart throbbed and sank it was unendurable he turned his deadly pale face to her his lips worked helplessly struggling to utter something a pang of terror passed through sonia s heart what s the matter she repeated drawing a little away from him nothing sonia don t be frightened it s nonsense it really is nonsense if you think of it he muttered like a man in delirium why have i come to torture you he added suddenly looking at her why really i keep asking myself that question sonia he had perhaps been asking himself that question a quarter of an hour before but now he spoke helplessly hardly knowing what he said and feeling a continual tremor all over oh how you are suffering she muttered in distress looking intently at him it s all nonsense listen sonia he suddenly smiled a pale helpless smile for two seconds you remember what i meant to tell you yesterday sonia waited uneasily i said as i went away that perhaps i was saying good bye for ever but that if i came to day i would tell you who who killed lizaveta she began trembling all over well here i ve come to tell you then you really meant it yesterday she whispered with difficulty how do you know she asked quickly as though suddenly regaining her reason sonia s face grew paler and paler and she breathed painfully i know she paused a minute have they found him she asked timidly no then how do you know about it she asked again hardly audibly and again after a minute s pause he turned to her and looked very intently at her guess he said with the same distorted helpless smile a shudder passed over her but you why do you frighten me like this she said smiling like a child i must be a great friend of his since i know raskolnikov went on still gazing into her face as though he could not turn his eyes away he did not mean to kill that lizaveta he killed her accidentally he meant to kill the old woman when she was alone and he went there and then lizaveta came in he killed her too another awful moment passed both still gazed at one another you can t guess then he asked suddenly feeling as though he were flinging himself down from a steeple n no whispered sonia take a good look as soon as he had said this again the same familiar sensation froze his heart he looked at her and all at once seemed to see in her face the face of lizaveta he remembered clearly the expression in lizaveta s face when he approached her with the axe and she stepped back to the wall putting out her hand with childish terror in her face looking as little children do when they begin to be frightened of something looking intently and uneasily at what frightens them shrinking back and holding out their little hands on the point of crying almost the same thing happened now to sonia with the same helplessness and the same terror she looked at him for a while and suddenly putting out her left hand pressed her fingers faintly against his breast and slowly began to get up from the bed moving further from him and keeping her eyes fixed even more immovably on him her terror infected him the same fear showed itself on his face in the same way he stared at her and almost with the same childish smile have you guessed he whispered at last good god broke in an awful wail from her bosom she sank helplessly on the bed with her face in the pillows but a moment later she got up moved quickly to him seized both his hands and gripping them tight in her thin fingers began looking into his face again with the same intent stare in this last desperate look she tried to look into him and catch some last hope but there was no hope there was no doubt remaining it was all true later on indeed when she recalled that moment she thought it strange and wondered why she had seen at once that there was no doubt she could not have said for instance that she had foreseen something of the sort and yet now as soon as he told her she suddenly fancied that she had really foreseen this very thing stop sonia enough don t torture me he begged her miserably it was not at all not at all like this he had thought of telling her but this is how it happened she jumped up seeming not to know what she was doing and wringing her hands walked into the middle of the room but quickly went back and sat down again beside him her shoulder almost touching his all of a sudden she started as though she had been stabbed uttered a cry and fell on her knees before him she did not know why what have you done what have you done to yourself she said in despair and jumping up she flung herself on his neck threw her arms round him and held him tightly raskolnikov drew back and looked at her with a mournful smile you are a strange girl sonia you kiss me and hug me when i tell you about that you don t think what you are doing there is no one no one in the whole world now so unhappy as you she cried in a frenzy not hearing what he said and she suddenly broke into violent hysterical weeping a feeling long unfamiliar to him flooded his heart and softened it at once he did not struggle against it two tears started into his eyes and hung on his eyelashes then you won t leave me sonia he said looking at her almost with hope no no never nowhere cried sonia i will follow you i will follow you everywhere oh my god oh how miserable i am why why didn t i know you before why didn t you come before oh dear here i have come yes now what s to be done now together together she repeated as it were unconsciously and she hugged him again i ll follow you to siberia he recoiled at this and the same hostile almost haughty smile came to his lips perhaps i don t want to go to siberia yet sonia he said sonia looked at him quickly again after her first passionate agonising sympathy for the unhappy man the terrible idea of the murder overwhelmed her in his changed tone she seemed to hear the murderer speaking she looked at him bewildered she knew nothing as yet why how with what object it had been now all these questions rushed at once into her mind and again she could not believe it he he is a murderer could it be true what s the meaning of it where am i she said in complete bewilderment as though still unable to recover herself how could you you a man like you how could you bring yourself to it what does it mean oh well to plunder leave off sonia he answered wearily almost with vexation sonia stood as though struck dumb but suddenly she cried you were hungry it was to help your mother yes no sonia no he muttered turning away and hanging his head i was not so hungry i certainly did want to help my mother but that s not the real thing either don t torture me sonia sonia clasped her hands could it could it all be true good god what a truth who could believe it and how could you give away your last farthing and yet rob and murder ah she cried suddenly that money you gave katerina ivanovna that money can that money no sonia he broke in hurriedly that money was not it don t worry yourself that money my mother sent me and it came when i was ill the day i gave it to you razumihin saw it he received it for me that money was mine my own sonia listened to him in bewilderment and did her utmost to comprehend and that money i don t even know really whether there was any money he added softly as though reflecting i took a purse off her neck made of chamois leather a purse stuffed full of something but i didn t look in it i suppose i hadn t time and the things chains and trinkets i buried under a stone with the purse next morning in a yard off the v prospect they are all there now sonia strained every nerve to listen then why why you said you did it to rob but you took nothing she asked quickly catching at a straw i don t know i haven t yet decided whether to take that money or not he said musing again and seeming to wake up with a start he gave a brief ironical smile ach what silly stuff i am talking eh the thought flashed through sonia s mind wasn t he mad but she dismissed it at once no it was something else she could make nothing of it nothing do you know sonia he said suddenly with conviction let me tell you if i d simply killed because i was hungry laying stress on every word and looking enigmatically but sincerely at her i should be happy now you must believe that what would it matter to you he cried a moment later with a sort of despair what would it matter to you if i were to confess that i did wrong what do you gain by such a stupid triumph over me ah sonia was it for that i ve come to you to day again sonia tried to say something but did not speak i asked you to go with me yesterday because you are all i have left go where asked sonia timidly not to steal and not to murder don t be anxious he smiled bitterly we are so different and you know sonia it s only now only this moment that i understand where i asked you to go with me yesterday yesterday when i said it i did not know where i asked you for one thing i came to you for one thing not to leave me you won t leave me sonia she squeezed his hand and why why did i tell her why did i let her know he cried a minute later in despair looking with infinite anguish at her here you expect an explanation from me sonia you are sitting and waiting for it i see that but what can i tell you you won t understand and will only suffer misery on my account well you are crying and embracing me again why do you do it because i couldn t bear my burden and have come to throw it on another you suffer too and i shall feel better and can you love such a mean wretch but aren t you suffering too cried sonia again a wave of the same feeling surged into his heart and again for an instant softened it sonia i have a bad heart take note of that it may explain a great deal i have come because i am bad there are men who wouldn t have come but i am a coward and a mean wretch but never mind that s not the point i must speak now but i don t know how to begin he paused and sank into thought ach we are so different he cried again we are not alike and why why did i come i shall never forgive myself that no no it was a good thing you came cried sonia it s better i should know far better he looked at her with anguish what if it were really that he said as though reaching a conclusion yes that s what it was i wanted to become a napoleon that is why i killed her do you understand now n no sonia whispered naively and timidly only speak speak i shall understand i shall understand in myself she kept begging him you ll understand very well we shall see he paused and was for some time lost in meditation it was like this i asked myself one day this question what if napoleon for instance had happened to be in my place and if he had not had toulon nor egypt nor the passage of mont blanc to begin his career with but instead of all those picturesque and monumental things there had simply been some ridiculous old hag a pawnbroker who had to be murdered too to get money from her trunk for his career you understand well would he have brought himself to that if there had been no other means wouldn t he have felt a pang at its being so far from monumental and and sinful too well i must tell you that i worried myself fearfully over that question so that i was awfully ashamed when i guessed at last all of a sudden somehow that it would not have given him the least pang that it would not even have struck him that it was not monumental that he would not have seen that there was anything in it to pause over and that if he had had no other way he would have strangled her in a minute without thinking about it well i too left off thinking about it murdered her following his example and that s exactly how it was do you think it funny yes sonia the funniest thing of all is that perhaps that s just how it was sonia did not think it at all funny you had better tell me straight out without examples she begged still more timidly and scarcely audibly he turned to her looked sadly at her and took her hands you are right again sonia of course that s all nonsense it s almost all talk you see you know of course that my mother has scarcely anything my sister happened to have a good education and was condemned to drudge as a governess all their hopes were centered on me i was a student but i couldn t keep myself at the university and was forced for a time to leave it even if i had lingered on like that in ten or twelve years i might with luck hope to be some sort of teacher or clerk with a salary of a thousand roubles he repeated it as though it were a lesson and by that time my mother would be worn out with grief and anxiety and i could not succeed in keeping her in comfort while my sister well my sister might well have fared worse and it s a hard thing to pass everything by all one s life to turn one s back upon everything to forget one s mother and decorously accept the insults inflicted on one s sister why should one when one has buried them to burden oneself with others wife and children and to leave them again without a farthing so i resolved to gain possession of the old woman s money and to use it for my first years without worrying my mother to keep myself at the university and for a little while after leaving it and to do this all on a broad thorough scale so as to build up a completely new career and enter upon a new life of independence well that s all well of course in killing the old woman i did wrong well that s enough he struggled to the end of his speech in exhaustion and let his head sink oh that s not it that s not it sonia cried in distress how could one no that s not right not right you see yourself that it s not right but i ve spoken truly it s the truth as though that could be the truth good god i ve only killed a louse sonia a useless loathsome harmful creature a human being a louse i too know it wasn t a louse he answered looking strangely at her but i am talking nonsense sonia he added i ve been talking nonsense a long time that s not it you are right there there were quite quite other causes for it i haven t talked to anyone for so long sonia my head aches dreadfully now his eyes shone with feverish brilliance he was almost delirious an uneasy smile strayed on his lips his terrible exhaustion could be seen through his excitement sonia saw how he was suffering she too was growing dizzy and he talked so strangely it seemed somehow comprehensible but yet but how how good god and she wrung her hands in despair no sonia that s not it he began again suddenly raising his head as though a new and sudden train of thought had struck and as it were roused him that s not it better imagine yes it s certainly better imagine that i am vain envious malicious base vindictive and well perhaps with a tendency to insanity let s have it all out at once they ve talked of madness already i noticed i told you just now i could not keep myself at the university but do you know that perhaps i might have done my mother would have sent me what i needed for the fees and i could have earned enough for clothes boots and food no doubt lessons had turned up at half a rouble razumihin works but i turned sulky and wouldn t yes sulkiness that s the right word for it i sat in my room like a spider you ve been in my den you ve seen it and do you know sonia that low ceilings and tiny rooms cramp the soul and the mind ah how i hated that garret and yet i wouldn t go out of it i wouldn t on purpose i didn t go out for days together and i wouldn t work i wouldn t even eat i just lay there doing nothing if nastasya brought me anything i ate it if she didn t i went all day without i wouldn t ask on purpose from sulkiness at night i had no light i lay in the dark and i wouldn t earn money for candles i ought to have studied but i sold my books and the dust lies an inch thick on the notebooks on my table i preferred lying still and thinking and i kept thinking and i had dreams all the time strange dreams of all sorts no need to describe only then i began to fancy that no that s not it again i am telling you wrong you see i kept asking myself then why am i so stupid that if others are stupid and i know they are yet i won t be wiser then i saw sonia that if one waits for everyone to get wiser it will take too long afterwards i understood that that would never come to pass that men won t change and that nobody can alter it and that it s not worth wasting effort over it yes that s so that s the law of their nature sonia that s so and i know now sonia that whoever is strong in mind and spirit will have power over them anyone who is greatly daring is right in their eyes he who despises most things will be a lawgiver among them and he who dares most of all will be most in the right so it has been till now and so it will always be a man must be blind not to see it though raskolnikov looked at sonia as he said this he no longer cared whether she understood or not the fever had complete hold of him he was in a sort of gloomy ecstasy he certainly had been too long without talking to anyone sonia felt that his gloomy creed had become his faith and code i divined then sonia he went on eagerly that power is only vouchsafed to the man who dares to stoop and pick it up there is only one thing one thing needful one has only to dare then for the first time in my life an idea took shape in my mind which no one had ever thought of before me no one i saw clear as daylight how strange it is that not a single person living in this mad world has had the daring to go straight for it all and send it flying to the devil i i wanted to have the daring and i killed her i only wanted to have the daring sonia that was the whole cause of it oh hush hush cried sonia clasping her hands you turned away from god and god has smitten you has given you over to the devil then sonia when i used to lie there in the dark and all this became clear to me was it a temptation of the devil eh hush don t laugh blasphemer you don t understand you don t understand oh god he won t understand hush sonia i am not laughing i know myself that it was the devil leading me hush sonia hush he repeated with gloomy insistence i know it all i have thought it all over and over and whispered it all over to myself lying there in the dark i ve argued it all over with myself every point of it and i know it all all and how sick how sick i was then of going over it all i have kept wanting to forget it and make a new beginning sonia and leave off thinking and you don t suppose that i went into it headlong like a fool i went into it like a wise man and that was just my destruction and you mustn t suppose that i didn t know for instance that if i began to question myself whether i had the right to gain power i certainly hadn t the right or that if i asked myself whether a human being is a louse it proved that it wasn t so for me though it might be for a man who would go straight to his goal without asking questions if i worried myself all those days wondering whether napoleon would have done it or not i felt clearly of course that i wasn t napoleon i had to endure all the agony of that battle of ideas sonia and i longed to throw it off i wanted to murder without casuistry to murder for my own sake for myself alone i didn t want to lie about it even to myself it wasn t to help my mother i did the murder that s nonsense i didn t do the murder to gain wealth and power and to become a benefactor of mankind nonsense i simply did it i did the murder for myself for myself alone and whether i became a benefactor to others or spent my life like a spider catching men in my web and sucking the life out of men i couldn t have cared at that moment and it was not the money i wanted sonia when i did it it was not so much the money i wanted but something else i know it all now understand me perhaps i should never have committed a murder again i wanted to find out something else it was something else led me on i wanted to find out then and quickly whether i was a louse like everybody else or a man whether i can step over barriers or not whether i dare stoop to pick up or not whether i am a trembling creature or whether i have the right to kill have the right to kill sonia clasped her hands ach sonia he cried irritably and seemed about to make some retort but was contemptuously silent don t interrupt me sonia i want to prove one thing only that the devil led me on then and he has shown me since that i had not the right to take that path because i am just such a louse as all the rest he was mocking me and here i ve come to you now welcome your guest if i were not a louse should i have come to you listen when i went then to the old woman s i only went to try you may be sure of that and you murdered her but how did i murder her is that how men do murders do men go to commit a murder as i went then i will tell you some day how i went did i murder the old woman i murdered myself not her i crushed myself once for all for ever but it was the devil that killed that old woman not i enough enough sonia enough let me be he cried in a sudden spasm of agony let me be he leaned his elbows on his knees and squeezed his head in his hands as in a vise what suffering a wail of anguish broke from sonia well what am i to do now he asked suddenly raising his head and looking at her with a face hideously distorted by despair what are you to do she cried jumping up and her eyes that had been full of tears suddenly began to shine stand up she seized him by the shoulder he got up looking at her almost bewildered go at once this very minute stand at the cross roads bow down first kiss the earth which you have defiled and then bow down to all the world and say to all men aloud i am a murderer then god will send you life again will you go will you go she asked him trembling all over snatching his two hands squeezing them tight in hers and gazing at him with eyes full of fire he was amazed at her sudden ecstasy you mean siberia sonia i must give myself up he asked gloomily suffer and expiate your sin by it that s what you must do no i am not going to them sonia but how will you go on living what will you live for cried sonia how is it possible now why how can you talk to your mother oh what will become of them now but what am i saying you have abandoned your mother and your sister already he has abandoned them already oh god she cried why he knows it all himself how how can he live by himself what will become of you now don t be a child sonia he said softly what wrong have i done them why should i go to them what should i say to them that s only a phantom they destroy men by millions themselves and look on it as a virtue they are knaves and scoundrels sonia i am not going to them and what should i say to them that i murdered her but did not dare to take the money and hid it under a stone he added with a bitter smile why they would laugh at me and would call me a fool for not getting it a coward and a fool they wouldn t understand and they don t deserve to understand why should i go to them i won t don t be a child sonia it will be too much for you to bear too much she repeated holding out her hands in despairing supplication perhaps i ve been unfair to myself he observed gloomily pondering perhaps after all i am a man and not a louse and i ve been in too great a hurry to condemn myself i ll make another fight for it a haughty smile appeared on his lips what a burden to bear and your whole life your whole life i shall get used to it he said grimly and thoughtfully listen he began a minute later stop crying it s time to talk of the facts i ve come to tell you that the police are after me on my track ach sonia cried in terror well why do you cry out you want me to go to siberia and now you are frightened but let me tell you i shall not give myself up i shall make a struggle for it and they won t do anything to me they ve no real evidence yesterday i was in great danger and believed i was lost but to day things are going better all the facts they know can be explained two ways that s to say i can turn their accusations to my credit do you understand and i shall for i ve learnt my lesson but they will certainly arrest me if it had not been for something that happened they would have done so to day for certain perhaps even now they will arrest me to day but that s no matter sonia they ll let me out again for there isn t any real proof against me and there won t be i give you my word for it and they can t convict a man on what they have against me enough i only tell you that you may know i will try to manage somehow to put it to my mother and sister so that they won t be frightened my sister s future is secure however now i believe and my mother s must be too well that s all be careful though will you come and see me in prison when i am there oh i will i will they sat side by side both mournful and dejected as though they had been cast up by the tempest alone on some deserted shore he looked at sonia and felt how great was her love for him and strange to say he felt it suddenly burdensome and painful to be so loved yes it was a strange and awful sensation on his way to see sonia he had felt that all his hopes rested on her he expected to be rid of at least part of his suffering and now when all her heart turned towards him he suddenly felt that he was immeasurably unhappier than before sonia he said you d better not come and see me when i am in prison sonia did not answer she was crying several minutes passed have you a cross on you she asked as though suddenly thinking of it he did not at first understand the question no of course not here take this one of cypress wood i have another a copper one that belonged to lizaveta i changed with lizaveta she gave me her cross and i gave her my little ikon i will wear lizaveta s now and give you this take it it s mine it s mine you know she begged him we will go to suffer together and together we will bear our cross give it me said raskolnikov he did not want to hurt her feelings but immediately he drew back the hand he held out for the cross not now sonia better later he added to comfort her yes yes better she repeated with conviction when you go to meet your suffering then put it on you will come to me i ll put it on you we will pray and go together at that moment someone knocked three times at the door sofya semyonovna may i come in they heard in a very familiar and polite voice sonia rushed to the door in a fright the flaxen head of mr lebeziatnikov appeared at the door chapter v lebeziatnikov looked perturbed i ve come to you sofya semyonovna he began excuse me i thought i should find you he said addressing raskolnikov suddenly that is i didn t mean anything of that sort but i just thought katerina ivanovna has gone out of her mind he blurted out suddenly turning from raskolnikov to sonia sonia screamed at least it seems so but we don t know what to do you see she came back she seems to have been turned out somewhere perhaps beaten so it seems at least she had run to your father s former chief she didn t find him at home he was dining at some other general s only fancy she rushed off there to the other general s and imagine she was so persistent that she managed to get the chief to see her had him fetched out from dinner it seems you can imagine what happened she was turned out of course but according to her own story she abused him and threw something at him one may well believe it how it is she wasn t taken up i can t understand now she is telling everyone including amalia ivanovna but it s difficult to understand her she is screaming and flinging herself about oh yes she shouts that since everyone has abandoned her she will take the children and go into the street with a barrel organ and the children will sing and dance and she too and collect money and will go every day under the general s window to let everyone see well born children whose father was an official begging in the street she keeps beating the children and they are all crying she is teaching lida to sing my village the boy to dance polenka the same she is tearing up all the clothes and making them little caps like actors she means to carry a tin basin and make it tinkle instead of music she won t listen to anything imagine the state of things it s beyond anything lebeziatnikov would have gone on but sonia who had heard him almost breathless snatched up her cloak and hat and ran out of the room putting on her things as she went raskolnikov followed her and lebeziatnikov came after him she has certainly gone mad he said to raskolnikov as they went out into the street i didn t want to frighten sofya semyonovna so i said it seemed like it but there isn t a doubt of it they say that in consumption the tubercles sometimes occur in the brain it s a pity i know nothing of medicine i did try to persuade her but she wouldn t listen did you talk to her about the tubercles not precisely of the tubercles besides she wouldn t have understood but what i say is that if you convince a person logically that he has nothing to cry about he ll stop crying that s clear is it your conviction that he won t life would be too easy if it were so answered raskolnikov excuse me excuse me of course it would be rather difficult for katerina ivanovna to understand but do you know that in paris they have been conducting serious experiments as to the possibility of curing the insane simply by logical argument one professor there a scientific man of standing lately dead believed in the possibility of such treatment his idea was that there s nothing really wrong with the physical organism of the insane and that insanity is so to say a logical mistake an error of judgment an incorrect view of things he gradually showed the madman his error and would you believe it they say he was successful but as he made use of douches too how far success was due to that treatment remains uncertain so it seems at least raskolnikov had long ceased to listen reaching the house where he lived he nodded to lebeziatnikov and went in at the gate lebeziatnikov woke up with a start looked about him and hurried on raskolnikov went into his little room and stood still in the middle of it why had he come back here he looked at the yellow and tattered paper at the dust at his sofa from the yard came a loud continuous knocking someone seemed to be hammering he went to the window rose on tiptoe and looked out into the yard for a long time with an air of absorbed attention but the yard was empty and he could not see who was hammering in the house on the left he saw some open windows on the window sills were pots of sickly looking geraniums linen was hung out of the windows he knew it all by heart he turned away and sat down on the sofa never never had he felt himself so fearfully alone yes he felt once more that he would perhaps come to hate sonia now that he had made her more miserable why had he gone to her to beg for her tears what need had he to poison her life oh the meanness of it i will remain alone he said resolutely and she shall not come to the prison five minutes later he raised his head with a strange smile that was a strange thought perhaps it really would be better in siberia he thought suddenly he could not have said how long he sat there with vague thoughts surging through his mind all at once the door opened and dounia came in at first she stood still and looked at him from the doorway just as he had done at sonia then she came in and sat down in the same place as yesterday on the chair facing him he looked silently and almost vacantly at her don t be angry brother i ve only come for one minute said dounia her face looked thoughtful but not stern her eyes were bright and soft he saw that she too had come to him with love brother now i know all all dmitri prokofitch has explained and told me everything they are worrying and persecuting you through a stupid and contemptible suspicion dmitri prokofitch told me that there is no danger and that you are wrong in looking upon it with such horror i don t think so and i fully understand how indignant you must be and that that indignation may have a permanent effect on you that s what i am afraid of as for your cutting yourself off from us i don t judge you i don t venture to judge you and forgive me for having blamed you for it i feel that i too if i had so great a trouble should keep away from everyone i shall tell mother nothing of this but i shall talk about you continually and shall tell her from you that you will come very soon don t worry about her i will set her mind at rest but don t you try her too much come once at least remember that she is your mother and now i have come simply to say dounia began to get up that if you should need me or should need all my life or anything call me and i ll come good bye she turned abruptly and went towards the door dounia raskolnikov stopped her and went towards her that razumihin dmitri prokofitch is a very good fellow dounia flushed slightly well she asked waiting a moment he is competent hardworking honest and capable of real love good bye dounia dounia flushed crimson then suddenly she took alarm but what does it mean brother are we really parting for ever that you give me such a parting message never mind good bye he turned away and walked to the window she stood a moment looked at him uneasily and went out troubled no he was not cold to her there was an instant the very last one when he had longed to take her in his arms and say good bye to her and even to tell her but he had not dared even to touch her hand afterwards she may shudder when she remembers that i embraced her and will feel that i stole her kiss and would she stand that test he went on a few minutes later to himself no she wouldn t girls like that can t stand things they never do and he thought of sonia there was a breath of fresh air from the window the daylight was fading he took up his cap and went out he could not of course and would not consider how ill he was but all this continual anxiety and agony of mind could not but affect him and if he were not lying in high fever it was perhaps just because this continual inner strain helped to keep him on his legs and in possession of his faculties but this artificial excitement could not last long he wandered aimlessly the sun was setting a special form of misery had begun to oppress him of late there was nothing poignant nothing acute about it but there was a feeling of permanence of eternity about it it brought a foretaste of hopeless years of this cold leaden misery a foretaste of an eternity on a square yard of space towards evening this sensation usually began to weigh on him more heavily with this idiotic purely physical weakness depending on the sunset or something one can t help doing something stupid you ll go to dounia as well as to sonia he muttered bitterly he heard his name called he looked round lebeziatnikov rushed up to him only fancy i ve been to your room looking for you only fancy she s carried out her plan and taken away the children sofya semyonovna and i have had a job to find them she is rapping on a frying pan and making the children dance the children are crying they keep stopping at the cross roads and in front of shops there s a crowd of fools running after them come along and sonia raskolnikov asked anxiously hurrying after lebeziatnikov simply frantic that is it s not sofya semyonovna s frantic but katerina ivanovna though sofya semyonova s frantic too but katerina ivanovna is absolutely frantic i tell you she is quite mad they ll be taken to the police you can fancy what an effect that will have they are on the canal bank near the bridge now not far from sofya semyonovna s quite close on the canal bank near the bridge and not two houses away from the one where sonia lodged there was a crowd of people consisting principally of gutter children the hoarse broken voice of katerina ivanovna could be heard from the bridge and it certainly was a strange spectacle likely to attract a street crowd katerina ivanovna in her old dress with the green shawl wearing a torn straw hat crushed in a hideous way on one side was really frantic she was exhausted and breathless her wasted consumptive face looked more suffering than ever and indeed out of doors in the sunshine a consumptive always looks worse than at home but her excitement did not flag and every moment her irritation grew more intense she rushed at the children shouted at them coaxed them told them before the crowd how to dance and what to sing began explaining to them why it was necessary and driven to desperation by their not understanding beat them then she would make a rush at the crowd if she noticed any decently dressed person stopping to look she immediately appealed to him to see what these children from a genteel one may say aristocratic house had been brought to if she heard laughter or jeering in the crowd she would rush at once at the scoffers and begin squabbling with them some people laughed others shook their heads but everyone felt curious at the sight of the madwoman with the frightened children the frying pan of which lebeziatnikov had spoken was not there at least raskolnikov did not see it but instead of rapping on the pan katerina ivanovna began clapping her wasted hands when she made lida and kolya dance and polenka sing she too joined in the singing but broke down at the second note with a fearful cough which made her curse in despair and even shed tears what made her most furious was the weeping and terror of kolya and lida some effort had been made to dress the children up as street singers are dressed the boy had on a turban made of something red and white to look like a turk there had been no costume for lida she simply had a red knitted cap or rather a night cap that had belonged to marmeladov decorated with a broken piece of white ostrich feather which had been katerina ivanovna s grandmother s and had been preserved as a family possession polenka was in her everyday dress she looked in timid perplexity at her mother and kept at her side hiding her tears she dimly realised her mother s condition and looked uneasily about her she was terribly frightened of the street and the crowd sonia followed katerina ivanovna weeping and beseeching her to return home but katerina ivanovna was not to be persuaded leave off sonia leave off she shouted speaking fast panting and coughing you don t know what you ask you are like a child i ve told you before that i am not coming back to that drunken german let everyone let all petersburg see the children begging in the streets though their father was an honourable man who served all his life in truth and fidelity and one may say died in the service katerina ivanovna had by now invented this fantastic story and thoroughly believed it let that wretch of a general see it and you are silly sonia what have we to eat tell me that we have worried you enough i won t go on so ah rodion romanovitch is that you she cried seeing raskolnikov and rushing up to him explain to this silly girl please that nothing better could be done even organ grinders earn their living and everyone will see at once that we are different that we are an honourable and bereaved family reduced to beggary and that general will lose his post you ll see we shall perform under his windows every day and if the tsar drives by i ll fall on my knees put the children before me show them to him and say defend us father he is the father of the fatherless he is merciful he ll protect us you ll see and that wretch of a general lida tenez vous droite kolya you ll dance again why are you whimpering whimpering again what are you afraid of stupid goodness what am i to do with them rodion romanovitch if you only knew how stupid they are what s one to do with such children and she almost crying herself which did not stop her uninterrupted rapid flow of talk pointed to the crying children raskolnikov tried to persuade her to go home and even said hoping to work on her vanity that it was unseemly for her to be wandering about the streets like an organ grinder as she was intending to become the principal of a boarding school a boarding school ha ha ha a castle in the air cried katerina ivanovna her laugh ending in a cough no rodion romanovitch that dream is over all have forsaken us and that general you know rodion romanovitch i threw an inkpot at him it happened to be standing in the waiting room by the paper where you sign your name i wrote my name threw it at him and ran away oh the scoundrels the scoundrels but enough of them now i ll provide for the children myself i won t bow down to anybody she has had to bear enough for us she pointed to sonia polenka how much have you got show me what only two farthings oh the mean wretches they give us nothing only run after us putting their tongues out there what is that blockhead laughing at she pointed to a man in the crowd it s all because kolya here is so stupid i have such a bother with him what do you want polenka tell me in french parlez moi francais why i ve taught you you know some phrases else how are you to show that you are of good family well brought up children and not at all like other organ grinders we aren t going to have a punch and judy show in the street but to sing a genteel song ah yes what are we to sing you keep putting me out but we you see we are standing here rodion romanovitch to find something to sing and get money something kolya can dance to for as you can fancy our performance is all impromptu we must talk it over and rehearse it all thoroughly and then we shall go to nevsky where there are far more people of good society and we shall be noticed at once lida knows my village only nothing but my village and everyone sings that we must sing something far more genteel well have you thought of anything polenka if only you d help your mother my memory s quite gone or i should have thought of something we really can t sing an hussar ah let us sing in french cinq sous i have taught it you i have taught it you and as it is in french people will see at once that you are children of good family and that will be much more touching you might sing marlborough s en va t en guerre for that s quite a child s song and is sung as a lullaby in all the aristocratic houses marlborough s en va t en guerre ne sait quand reviendra she began singing but no better sing cinq sous now kolya your hands on your hips make haste and you lida keep turning the other way and polenka and i will sing and clap our hands cinq sous cinq sous pour monter notre menage cough cough cough set your dress straight polenka it s slipped down on your shoulders she observed panting from coughing now it s particularly necessary to behave nicely and genteelly that all may see that you are well born children i said at the time that the bodice should be cut longer and made of two widths it was your fault sonia with your advice to make it shorter and now you see the child is quite deformed by it why you re all crying again what s the matter stupids come kolya begin make haste make haste oh what an unbearable child cinq sous cinq sous a policeman again what do you want a policeman was indeed forcing his way through the crowd but at that moment a gentleman in civilian uniform and an overcoat a solid looking official of about fifty with a decoration on his neck which delighted katerina ivanovna and had its effect on the policeman approached and without a word handed her a green three rouble note his face wore a look of genuine sympathy katerina ivanovna took it and gave him a polite even ceremonious bow i thank you honoured sir she began loftily the causes that have induced us take the money polenka you see there are generous and honourable people who are ready to help a poor gentlewoman in distress you see honoured sir these orphans of good family i might even say of aristocratic connections and that wretch of a general sat eating grouse and stamped at my disturbing him your excellency i said protect the orphans for you knew my late husband semyon zaharovitch and on the very day of his death the basest of scoundrels slandered his only daughter that policeman again protect me she cried to the official why is that policeman edging up to me we have only just run away from one of them what do you want fool it s forbidden in the streets you mustn t make a disturbance it s you re making a disturbance it s just the same as if i were grinding an organ what business is it of yours you have to get a licence for an organ and you haven t got one and in that way you collect a crowd where do you lodge what a license wailed katerina ivanovna i buried my husband to day what need of a license calm yourself madam calm yourself began the official come along i will escort you this is no place for you in the crowd you are ill honoured sir honoured sir you don t know screamed katerina ivanovna we are going to the nevsky sonia sonia where is she she is crying too what s the matter with you all kolya lida where are you going she cried suddenly in alarm oh silly children kolya lida where are they off to kolya and lida scared out of their wits by the crowd and their mother s mad pranks suddenly seized each other by the hand and ran off at the sight of the policeman who wanted to take them away somewhere weeping and wailing poor katerina ivanovna ran after them she was a piteous and unseemly spectacle as she ran weeping and panting for breath sonia and polenka rushed after them bring them back bring them back sonia oh stupid ungrateful children polenka catch them it s for your sakes i she stumbled as she ran and fell down she s cut herself she s bleeding oh dear cried sonia bending over her all ran up and crowded around raskolnikov and lebeziatnikov were the first at her side the official too hastened up and behind him the policeman who muttered bother with a gesture of impatience feeling that the job was going to be a troublesome one pass on pass on he said to the crowd that pressed forward she s dying someone shouted she s gone out of her mind said another lord have mercy upon us said a woman crossing herself have they caught the little girl and the boy they re being brought back the elder one s got them ah the naughty imps when they examined katerina ivanovna carefully they saw that she had not cut herself against a stone as sonia thought but that the blood that stained the pavement red was from her chest i ve seen that before muttered the official to raskolnikov and lebeziatnikov that s consumption the blood flows and chokes the patient i saw the same thing with a relative of my own not long ago nearly a pint of blood all in a minute what s to be done though she is dying this way this way to my room sonia implored i live here see that house the second from here come to me make haste she turned from one to the other send for the doctor oh dear thanks to the official s efforts this plan was adopted the policeman even helping to carry katerina ivanovna she was carried to sonia s room almost unconscious and laid on the bed the blood was still flowing but she seemed to be coming to herself raskolnikov lebeziatnikov and the official accompanied sonia into the room and were followed by the policeman who first drove back the crowd which followed to the very door polenka came in holding kolya and lida who were trembling and weeping several persons came in too from the kapernaumovs room the landlord a lame one eyed man of strange appearance with whiskers and hair that stood up like a brush his wife a woman with an everlastingly scared expression and several open mouthed children with wonder struck faces among these svidrigailov suddenly made his appearance raskolnikov looked at him with surprise not understanding where he had come from and not having noticed him in the crowd a doctor and priest wore spoken of the official whispered to raskolnikov that he thought it was too late now for the doctor but he ordered him to be sent for kapernaumov ran himself meanwhile katerina ivanovna had regained her breath the bleeding ceased for a time she looked with sick but intent and penetrating eyes at sonia who stood pale and trembling wiping the sweat from her brow with a handkerchief at last she asked to be raised they sat her up on the bed supporting her on both sides where are the children she said in a faint voice you ve brought them polenka oh the sillies why did you run away och once more her parched lips were covered with blood she moved her eyes looking about her so that s how you live sonia never once have i been in your room she looked at her with a face of suffering we have been your ruin sonia polenka lida kolya come here well here they are sonia take them all i hand them over to you i ve had enough the ball is over cough lay me down let me die in peace they laid her back on the pillow what the priest i don t want him you haven t got a rouble to spare i have no sins god must forgive me without that he knows how i have suffered and if he won t forgive me i don t care she sank more and more into uneasy delirium at times she shuddered turned her eyes from side to side recognised everyone for a minute but at once sank into delirium again her breathing was hoarse and difficult there was a sort of rattle in her throat i said to him your excellency she ejaculated gasping after each word that amalia ludwigovna ah lida kolya hands on your hips make haste glissez glissez pas de basque tap with your heels be a graceful child du hast diamanten und perlen what next that s the thing to sing du hast die schonsten augen madchen was willst du mehr what an idea was willst du mehr what things the fool invents ah yes in the heat of midday in the vale of dagestan ah how i loved it i loved that song to distraction polenka your father you know used to sing it when we were engaged oh those days oh that s the thing for us to sing how does it go i ve forgotten remind me how was it she was violently excited and tried to sit up at last in a horribly hoarse broken voice she began shrieking and gasping at every word with a look of growing terror in the heat of midday in the vale of dagestan with lead in my breast your excellency she wailed suddenly with a heart rending scream and a flood of tears protect the orphans you have been their father s guest one may say aristocratic she started regaining consciousness and gazed at all with a sort of terror but at once recognised sonia sonia sonia she articulated softly and caressingly as though surprised to find her there sonia darling are you here too they lifted her up again enough it s over farewell poor thing i am done for i am broken she cried with vindictive despair and her head fell heavily back on the pillow she sank into unconsciousness again but this time it did not last long her pale yellow wasted face dropped back her mouth fell open her leg moved convulsively she gave a deep deep sigh and died sonia fell upon her flung her arms about her and remained motionless with her head pressed to the dead woman s wasted bosom polenka threw herself at her mother s feet kissing them and weeping violently though kolya and lida did not understand what had happened they had a feeling that it was something terrible they put their hands on each other s little shoulders stared straight at one another and both at once opened their mouths and began screaming they were both still in their fancy dress one in a turban the other in the cap with the ostrich feather and how did the certificate of merit come to be on the bed beside katerina ivanovna it lay there by the pillow raskolnikov saw it he walked away to the window lebeziatnikov skipped up to him she is dead he said rodion romanovitch i must have two words with you said svidrigailov coming up to them lebeziatnikov at once made room for him and delicately withdrew svidrigailov drew raskolnikov further away i will undertake all the arrangements the funeral and that you know it s a question of money and as i told you i have plenty to spare i will put those two little ones and polenka into some good orphan asylum and i will settle fifteen hundred roubles to be paid to each on coming of age so that sofya semyonovna need have no anxiety about them and i will pull her out of the mud too for she is a good girl isn t she so tell avdotya romanovna that that is how i am spending her ten thousand what is your motive for such benevolence asked raskolnikov ah you sceptical person laughed svidrigailov i told you i had no need of that money won t you admit that it s simply done from humanity she wasn t a louse you know he pointed to the corner where the dead woman lay was she like some old pawnbroker woman come you ll agree is luzhin to go on living and doing wicked things or is she to die and if i didn t help them polenka would go the same way he said this with an air of a sort of gay winking slyness keeping his eyes fixed on raskolnikov who turned white and cold hearing his own phrases spoken to sonia he quickly stepped back and looked wildly at svidrigailov how do you know he whispered hardly able to breathe why i lodge here at madame resslich s the other side of the wall here is kapernaumov and there lives madame resslich an old and devoted friend of mine i am a neighbour you yes continued svidrigailov shaking with laughter i assure you on my honour dear rodion romanovitch that you have interested me enormously i told you we should become friends i foretold it well here we have and you will see what an accommodating person i am you ll see that you can get on with me part vi chapter i a strange period began for raskolnikov it was as though a fog had fallen upon him and wrapped him in a dreary solitude from which there was no escape recalling that period long after he believed that his mind had been clouded at times and that it had continued so with intervals till the final catastrophe he was convinced that he had been mistaken about many things at that time for instance as to the date of certain events anyway when he tried later on to piece his recollections together he learnt a great deal about himself from what other people told him he had mixed up incidents and had explained events as due to circumstances which existed only in his imagination at times he was a prey to agonies of morbid uneasiness amounting sometimes to panic but he remembered too moments hours perhaps whole days of complete apathy which came upon him as a reaction from his previous terror and might be compared with the abnormal insensibility sometimes seen in the dying he seemed to be trying in that latter stage to escape from a full and clear understanding of his position certain essential facts which required immediate consideration were particularly irksome to him how glad he would have been to be free from some cares the neglect of which would have threatened him with complete inevitable ruin he was particularly worried about svidrigailov he might be said to be permanently thinking of svidrigailov from the time of svidrigailov s too menacing and unmistakable words in sonia s room at the moment of katerina ivanovna s death the normal working of his mind seemed to break down but although this new fact caused him extreme uneasiness raskolnikov was in no hurry for an explanation of it at times finding himself in a solitary and remote part of the town in some wretched eating house sitting alone lost in thought hardly knowing how he had come there he suddenly thought of svidrigailov he recognised suddenly clearly and with dismay that he ought at once to come to an understanding with that man and to make what terms he could walking outside the city gates one day he positively fancied that they had fixed a meeting there that he was waiting for svidrigailov another time he woke up before daybreak lying on the ground under some bushes and could not at first understand how he had come there but during the two or three days after katerina ivanovna s death he had two or three times met svidrigailov at sonia s lodging where he had gone aimlessly for a moment they exchanged a few words and made no reference to the vital subject as though they were tacitly agreed not to speak of it for a time katerina ivanovna s body was still lying in the coffin svidrigailov was busy making arrangements for the funeral sonia too was very busy at their last meeting svidrigailov informed raskolnikov that he had made an arrangement and a very satisfactory one for katerina ivanovna s children that he had through certain connections succeeded in getting hold of certain personages by whose help the three orphans could be at once placed in very suitable institutions that the money he had settled on them had been of great assistance as it is much easier to place orphans with some property than destitute ones he said something too about sonia and promised to come himself in a day or two to see raskolnikov mentioning that he would like to consult with him that there were things they must talk over this conversation took place in the passage on the stairs svidrigailov looked intently at raskolnikov and suddenly after a brief pause dropping his voice asked but how is it rodion romanovitch you don t seem yourself you look and you listen but you don t seem to understand cheer up we ll talk things over i am only sorry i ve so much to do of my own business and other people s ah rodion romanovitch he added suddenly what all men need is fresh air fresh air more than anything he moved to one side to make way for the priest and server who were coming up the stairs they had come for the requiem service by svidrigailov s orders it was sung twice a day punctually svidrigailov went his way raskolnikov stood still a moment thought and followed the priest into sonia s room he stood at the door they began quietly slowly and mournfully singing the service from his childhood the thought of death and the presence of death had something oppressive and mysteriously awful and it was long since he had heard the requiem service and there was something else here as well too awful and disturbing he looked at the children they were all kneeling by the coffin polenka was weeping behind them sonia prayed softly and as it were timidly weeping these last two days she hasn t said a word to me she hasn t glanced at me raskolnikov thought suddenly the sunlight was bright in the room the incense rose in clouds the priest read give rest oh lord raskolnikov stayed all through the service as he blessed them and took his leave the priest looked round strangely after the service raskolnikov went up to sonia she took both his hands and let her head sink on his shoulder this slight friendly gesture bewildered raskolnikov it seemed strange to him that there was no trace of repugnance no trace of disgust no tremor in her hand it was the furthest limit of self abnegation at least so he interpreted it sonia said nothing raskolnikov pressed her hand and went out he felt very miserable if it had been possible to escape to some solitude he would have thought himself lucky even if he had to spend his whole life there but although he had almost always been by himself of late he had never been able to feel alone sometimes he walked out of the town on to the high road once he had even reached a little wood but the lonelier the place was the more he seemed to be aware of an uneasy presence near him it did not frighten him but greatly annoyed him so that he made haste to return to the town to mingle with the crowd to enter restaurants and taverns to walk in busy thoroughfares there he felt easier and even more solitary one day at dusk he sat for an hour listening to songs in a tavern and he remembered that he positively enjoyed it but at last he had suddenly felt the same uneasiness again as though his conscience smote him here i sit listening to singing is that what i ought to be doing he thought yet he felt at once that that was not the only cause of his uneasiness there was something requiring immediate decision but it was something he could not clearly understand or put into words it was a hopeless tangle no better the struggle again better porfiry again or svidrigailov better some challenge again some attack yes yes he thought he went out of the tavern and rushed away almost at a run the thought of dounia and his mother suddenly reduced him almost to a panic that night he woke up before morning among some bushes in krestovsky island trembling all over with fever he walked home and it was early morning when he arrived after some hours sleep the fever left him but he woke up late two o clock in the afternoon he remembered that katerina ivanovna s funeral had been fixed for that day and was glad that he was not present at it nastasya brought him some food he ate and drank with appetite almost with greediness his head was fresher and he was calmer than he had been for the last three days he even felt a passing wonder at his previous attacks of panic the door opened and razumihin came in ah he s eating then he s not ill said razumihin he took a chair and sat down at the table opposite raskolnikov he was troubled and did not attempt to conceal it he spoke with evident annoyance but without hurry or raising his voice he looked as though he had some special fixed determination listen he began resolutely as far as i am concerned you may all go to hell but from what i see it s clear to me that i can t make head or tail of it please don t think i ve come to ask you questions i don t want to know hang it if you begin telling me your secrets i dare say i shouldn t stay to listen i should go away cursing i have only come to find out once for all whether it s a fact that you are mad there is a conviction in the air that you are mad or very nearly so i admit i ve been disposed to that opinion myself judging from your stupid repulsive and quite inexplicable actions and from your recent behavior to your mother and sister only a monster or a madman could treat them as you have so you must be mad when did you see them last just now haven t you seen them since then what have you been doing with yourself tell me please i ve been to you three times already your mother has been seriously ill since yesterday she had made up her mind to come to you avdotya romanovna tried to prevent her she wouldn t hear a word if he is ill if his mind is giving way who can look after him like his mother she said we all came here together we couldn t let her come alone all the way we kept begging her to be calm we came in you weren t here she sat down and stayed ten minutes while we stood waiting in silence she got up and said if he s gone out that is if he is well and has forgotten his mother it s humiliating and unseemly for his mother to stand at his door begging for kindness she returned home and took to her bed now she is in a fever i see she said that he has time for his girl she means by your girl sofya semyonovna your betrothed or your mistress i don t know i went at once to sofya semyonovna s for i wanted to know what was going on i looked round i saw the coffin the children crying and sofya semyonovna trying them on mourning dresses no sign of you i apologised came away and reported to avdotya romanovna so that s all nonsense and you haven t got a girl the most likely thing is that you are mad but here you sit guzzling boiled beef as though you d not had a bite for three days though as far as that goes madmen eat too but though you have not said a word to me yet you are not mad that i d swear above all you are not mad so you may go to hell all of you for there s some mystery some secret about it and i don t intend to worry my brains over your secrets so i ve simply come to swear at you he finished getting up to relieve my mind and i know what to do now what do you mean to do now what business is it of yours what i mean to do you are going in for a drinking bout how how did you know why it s pretty plain razumihin paused for a minute you always have been a very rational person and you ve never been mad never he observed suddenly with warmth you re right i shall drink good bye and he moved to go out i was talking with my sister the day before yesterday i think it was about you razumihin about me but where can you have seen her the day before yesterday razumihin stopped short and even turned a little pale one could see that his heart was throbbing slowly and violently she came here by herself sat there and talked to me she did yes what did you say to her i mean about me i told her you were a very good honest and industrious man i didn t tell her you love her because she knows that herself she knows that herself well it s pretty plain wherever i might go whatever happened to me you would remain to look after them i so to speak give them into your keeping razumihin i say this because i know quite well how you love her and am convinced of the purity of your heart i know that she too may love you and perhaps does love you already now decide for yourself as you know best whether you need go in for a drinking bout or not rodya you see well ach damn it but where do you mean to go of course if it s all a secret never mind but i i shall find out the secret and i am sure that it must be some ridiculous nonsense and that you ve made it all up anyway you are a capital fellow a capital fellow that was just what i wanted to add only you interrupted that that was a very good decision of yours not to find out these secrets leave it to time don t worry about it you ll know it all in time when it must be yesterday a man said to me that what a man needs is fresh air fresh air fresh air i mean to go to him directly to find out what he meant by that razumihin stood lost in thought and excitement making a silent conclusion he s a political conspirator he must be and he s on the eve of some desperate step that s certain it can only be that and and dounia knows he thought suddenly so avdotya romanovna comes to see you he said weighing each syllable and you re going to see a man who says we need more air and so of course that letter that too must have something to do with it he concluded to himself what letter she got a letter to day it upset her very much very much indeed too much so i began speaking of you she begged me not to then then she said that perhaps we should very soon have to part then she began warmly thanking me for something then she went to her room and locked herself in she got a letter raskolnikov asked thoughtfully yes and you didn t know hm they were both silent good bye rodion there was a time brother when i never mind good bye you see there was a time well good bye i must be off too i am not going to drink there s no need now that s all stuff he hurried out but when he had almost closed the door behind him he suddenly opened it again and said looking away oh by the way do you remember that murder you know porfiry s that old woman do you know the murderer has been found he has confessed and given the proofs it s one of those very workmen the painter only fancy do you remember i defended them here would you believe it all that scene of fighting and laughing with his companions on the stairs while the porter and the two witnesses were going up he got up on purpose to disarm suspicion the cunning the presence of mind of the young dog one can hardly credit it but it s his own explanation he has confessed it all and what a fool i was about it well he s simply a genius of hypocrisy and resourcefulness in disarming the suspicions of the lawyers so there s nothing much to wonder at i suppose of course people like that are always possible and the fact that he couldn t keep up the character but confessed makes him easier to believe in but what a fool i was i was frantic on their side tell me please from whom did you hear that and why does it interest you so raskolnikov asked with unmistakable agitation what next you ask me why it interests me well i heard it from porfiry among others it was from him i heard almost all about it from porfiry from porfiry what what did he say raskolnikov asked in dismay he gave me a capital explanation of it psychologically after his fashion he explained it explained it himself yes yes good bye i ll tell you all about it another time but now i m busy there was a time when i fancied but no matter another time what need is there for me to drink now you have made me drunk without wine i am drunk rodya good bye i m going i ll come again very soon he went out he s a political conspirator there s not a doubt about it razumihin decided as he slowly descended the stairs and he s drawn his sister in that s quite quite in keeping with avdotya romanovna s character there are interviews between them she hinted at it too so many of her words and hints bear that meaning and how else can all this tangle be explained hm and i was almost thinking good heavens what i thought yes i took leave of my senses and i wronged him it was his doing under the lamp in the corridor that day pfoo what a crude nasty vile idea on my part nikolay is a brick for confessing and how clear it all is now his illness then all his strange actions before this in the university how morose he used to be how gloomy but what s the meaning now of that letter there s something in that too perhaps whom was it from i suspect no i must find out he thought of dounia realising all he had heard and his heart throbbed and he suddenly broke into a run as soon as razumihin went out raskolnikov got up turned to the window walked into one corner and then into another as though forgetting the smallness of his room and sat down again on the sofa he felt so to speak renewed again the struggle so a means of escape had come yes a means of escape had come it had been too stifling too cramping the burden had been too agonising a lethargy had come upon him at times from the moment of the scene with nikolay at porfiry s he had been suffocating penned in without hope of escape after nikolay s confession on that very day had come the scene with sonia his behaviour and his last words had been utterly unlike anything he could have imagined beforehand he had grown feebler instantly and fundamentally and he had agreed at the time with sonia he had agreed in his heart he could not go on living alone with such a thing on his mind and svidrigailov was a riddle he worried him that was true but somehow not on the same point he might still have a struggle to come with svidrigailov svidrigailov too might be a means of escape but porfiry was a different matter and so porfiry himself had explained it to razumihin had explained it psychologically he had begun bringing in his damned psychology again porfiry but to think that porfiry should for one moment believe that nikolay was guilty after what had passed between them before nikolay s appearance after that tete a tete interview which could have only one explanation during those days raskolnikov had often recalled passages in that scene with porfiry he could not bear to let his mind rest on it such words such gestures had passed between them they had exchanged such glances things had been said in such a tone and had reached such a pass that nikolay whom porfiry had seen through at the first word at the first gesture could not have shaken his conviction and to think that even razumihin had begun to suspect the scene in the corridor under the lamp had produced its effect then he had rushed to porfiry but what had induced the latter to receive him like that what had been his object in putting razumihin off with nikolay he must have some plan there was some design but what was it it was true that a long time had passed since that morning too long a time and no sight nor sound of porfiry well that was a bad sign raskolnikov took his cap and went out of the room still pondering it was the first time for a long while that he had felt clear in his mind at least i must settle svidrigailov he thought and as soon as possible he too seems to be waiting for me to come to him of my own accord and at that moment there was such a rush of hate in his weary heart that he might have killed either of those two porfiry or svidrigailov at least he felt that he would be capable of doing it later if not now we shall see we shall see he repeated to himself but no sooner had he opened the door than he stumbled upon porfiry himself in the passage he was coming in to see him raskolnikov was dumbfounded for a minute but only for one minute strange to say he was not very much astonished at seeing porfiry and scarcely afraid of him he was simply startled but was quickly instantly on his guard perhaps this will mean the end but how could porfiry have approached so quietly like a cat so that he had heard nothing could he have been listening at the door you didn t expect a visitor rodion romanovitch porfiry explained laughing i ve been meaning to look in a long time i was passing by and thought why not go in for five minutes are you going out i won t keep you long just let me have one cigarette sit down porfiry petrovitch sit down raskolnikov gave his visitor a seat with so pleased and friendly an expression that he would have marvelled at himself if he could have seen it the last moment had come the last drops had to be drained so a man will sometimes go through half an hour of mortal terror with a brigand yet when the knife is at his throat at last he feels no fear raskolnikov seated himself directly facing porfiry and looked at him without flinching porfiry screwed up his eyes and began lighting a cigarette speak speak seemed as though it would burst from raskolnikov s heart come why don t you speak chapter ii ah these cigarettes porfiry petrovitch ejaculated at last having lighted one they are pernicious positively pernicious and yet i can t give them up i cough i begin to have tickling in my throat and a difficulty in breathing you know i am a coward i went lately to dr b n he always gives at least half an hour to each patient he positively laughed looking at me he sounded me tobacco s bad for you he said your lungs are affected but how am i to give it up what is there to take its place i don t drink that s the mischief he he he that i don t everything is relative rodion romanovitch everything is relative why he s playing his professional tricks again raskolnikov thought with disgust all the circumstances of their last interview suddenly came back to him and he felt a rush of the feeling that had come upon him then i came to see you the day before yesterday in the evening you didn t know porfiry petrovitch went on looking round the room i came into this very room i was passing by just as i did to day and i thought i d return your call i walked in as your door was wide open i looked round waited and went out without leaving my name with your servant don t you lock your door raskolnikov s face grew more and more gloomy porfiry seemed to guess his state of mind i ve come to have it out with you rodion romanovitch my dear fellow i owe you an explanation and must give it to you he continued with a slight smile just patting raskolnikov s knee but almost at the same instant a serious and careworn look came into his face to his surprise raskolnikov saw a touch of sadness in it he had never seen and never suspected such an expression in his face a strange scene passed between us last time we met rodion romanovitch our first interview too was a strange one but then and one thing after another this is the point i have perhaps acted unfairly to you i feel it do you remember how we parted your nerves were unhinged and your knees were shaking and so were mine and you know our behaviour was unseemly even ungentlemanly and yet we are gentlemen above all in any case gentlemen that must be understood do you remember what we came to and it was quite indecorous what is he up to what does he take me for raskolnikov asked himself in amazement raising his head and looking with open eyes on porfiry i ve decided openness is better between us porfiry petrovitch went on turning his head away and dropping his eyes as though unwilling to disconcert his former victim and as though disdaining his former wiles yes such suspicions and such scenes cannot continue for long nikolay put a stop to it or i don t know what we might not have come to that damned workman was sitting at the time in the next room can you realise that you know that of course and i am aware that he came to you afterwards but what you supposed then was not true i had not sent for anyone i had made no kind of arrangements you ask why i hadn t what shall i say to you it had all come upon me so suddenly i had scarcely sent for the porters you noticed them as you went out i dare say an idea flashed upon me i was firmly convinced at the time you see rodion romanovitch come i thought even if i let one thing slip for a time i shall get hold of something else i shan t lose what i want anyway you are nervously irritable rodion romanovitch by temperament it s out of proportion with other qualities of your heart and character which i flatter myself i have to some extent divined of course i did reflect even then that it does not always happen that a man gets up and blurts out his whole story it does happen sometimes if you make a man lose all patience though even then it s rare i was capable of realising that if i only had a fact i thought the least little fact to go upon something i could lay hold of something tangible not merely psychological for if a man is guilty you must be able to get something substantial out of him one may reckon upon most surprising results indeed i was reckoning on your temperament rodion romanovitch on your temperament above all things i had great hopes of you at that time but what are you driving at now raskolnikov muttered at last asking the question without thinking what is he talking about he wondered distractedly does he really take me to be innocent what am i driving at i ve come to explain myself i consider it my duty so to speak i want to make clear to you how the whole business the whole misunderstanding arose i ve caused you a great deal of suffering rodion romanovitch i am not a monster i understand what it must mean for a man who has been unfortunate but who is proud imperious and above all impatient to have to bear such treatment i regard you in any case as a man of noble character and not without elements of magnanimity though i don t agree with all your convictions i wanted to tell you this first frankly and quite sincerely for above all i don t want to deceive you when i made your acquaintance i felt attracted by you perhaps you will laugh at my saying so you have a right to i know you disliked me from the first and indeed you ve no reason to like me you may think what you like but i desire now to do all i can to efface that impression and to show that i am a man of heart and conscience i speak sincerely porfiry petrovitch made a dignified pause raskolnikov felt a rush of renewed alarm the thought that porfiry believed him to be innocent began to make him uneasy it s scarcely necessary to go over everything in detail porfiry petrovitch went on indeed i could scarcely attempt it to begin with there were rumours through whom how and when those rumours came to me and how they affected you i need not go into my suspicions were aroused by a complete accident which might just as easily not have happened what was it hm i believe there is no need to go into that either those rumours and that accident led to one idea in my mind i admit it openly for one may as well make a clean breast of it i was the first to pitch on you the old woman s notes on the pledges and the rest of it that all came to nothing yours was one of a hundred i happened too to hear of the scene at the office from a man who described it capitally unconsciously reproducing the scene with great vividness it was just one thing after another rodion romanovitch my dear fellow how could i avoid being brought to certain ideas from a hundred rabbits you can t make a horse a hundred suspicions don t make a proof as the english proverb says but that s only from the rational point of view you can t help being partial for after all a lawyer is only human i thought too of your article in that journal do you remember on your first visit we talked of it i jeered at you at the time but that was only to lead you on i repeat rodion romanovitch you are ill and impatient that you were bold headstrong in earnest and had felt a great deal i recognised long before i too have felt the same so that your article seemed familiar to me it was conceived on sleepless nights with a throbbing heart in ecstasy and suppressed enthusiasm and that proud suppressed enthusiasm in young people is dangerous i jeered at you then but let me tell you that as a literary amateur i am awfully fond of such first essays full of the heat of youth there is a mistiness and a chord vibrating in the mist your article is absurd and fantastic but there s a transparent sincerity a youthful incorruptible pride and the daring of despair in it it s a gloomy article but that s what s fine in it i read your article and put it aside thinking as i did so that man won t go the common way well i ask you after that as a preliminary how could i help being carried away by what followed oh dear i am not saying anything i am not making any statement now i simply noted it at the time what is there in it i reflected there s nothing in it that is really nothing and perhaps absolutely nothing and it s not at all the thing for the prosecutor to let himself be carried away by notions here i have nikolay on my hands with actual evidence against him you may think what you like of it but it s evidence he brings in his psychology too one has to consider him too for it s a matter of life and death why am i explaining this to you that you may understand and not blame my malicious behaviour on that occasion it was not malicious i assure you he he do you suppose i didn t come to search your room at the time i did i did he he i was here when you were lying ill in bed not officially not in my own person but i was here your room was searched to the last thread at the first suspicion but umsonst i thought to myself now that man will come will come of himself and quickly too if he s guilty he s sure to come another man wouldn t but he will and you remember how mr razumihin began discussing the subject with you we arranged that to excite you so we purposely spread rumours that he might discuss the case with you and razumihin is not a man to restrain his indignation mr zametov was tremendously struck by your anger and your open daring think of blurting out in a restaurant i killed her it was too daring too reckless i thought so myself if he is guilty he will be a formidable opponent that was what i thought at the time i was expecting you but you simply bowled zametov over and well you see it all lies in this that this damnable psychology can be taken two ways well i kept expecting you and so it was you came my heart was fairly throbbing ach now why need you have come your laughter too as you came in do you remember i saw it all plain as daylight but if i hadn t expected you so specially i should not have noticed anything in your laughter you see what influence a mood has mr razumihin then ah that stone that stone under which the things were hidden i seem to see it somewhere in a kitchen garden it was in a kitchen garden you told zametov and afterwards you repeated that in my office and when we began picking your article to pieces how you explained it one could take every word of yours in two senses as though there were another meaning hidden so in this way rodion romanovitch i reached the furthest limit and knocking my head against a post i pulled myself up asking myself what i was about after all i said you can take it all in another sense if you like and it s more natural so indeed i couldn t help admitting it was more natural i was bothered no i d better get hold of some little fact i said so when i heard of the bell ringing i held my breath and was all in a tremor here is my little fact thought i and i didn t think it over i simply wouldn t i would have given a thousand roubles at that minute to have seen you with my own eyes when you walked a hundred paces beside that workman after he had called you murderer to your face and you did not dare to ask him a question all the way and then what about your trembling what about your bell ringing in your illness in semi delirium and so rodion romanovitch can you wonder that i played such pranks on you and what made you come at that very minute someone seemed to have sent you by jove and if nikolay had not parted us and do you remember nikolay at the time do you remember him clearly it was a thunderbolt a regular thunderbolt and how i met him i didn t believe in the thunderbolt not for a minute you could see it for yourself and how could i even afterwards when you had gone and he began making very very plausible answers on certain points so that i was surprised at him myself even then i didn t believe his story you see what it is to be as firm as a rock no thought i morgenfruh what has nikolay got to do with it razumihin told me just now that you think nikolay guilty and had yourself assured him of it his voice failed him and he broke off he had been listening in indescribable agitation as this man who had seen through and through him went back upon himself he was afraid of believing it and did not believe it in those still ambiguous words he kept eagerly looking for something more definite and conclusive mr razumihin cried porfiry petrovitch seeming glad of a question from raskolnikov who had till then been silent he he he but i had to put mr razumihin off two is company three is none mr razumihin is not the right man besides he is an outsider he came running to me with a pale face but never mind him why bring him in to return to nikolay would you like to know what sort of a type he is how i understand him that is to begin with he is still a child and not exactly a coward but something by way of an artist really don t laugh at my describing him so he is innocent and responsive to influence he has a heart and is a fantastic fellow he sings and dances he tells stories they say so that people come from other villages to hear him he attends school too and laughs till he cries if you hold up a finger to him he will drink himself senseless not as a regular vice but at times when people treat him like a child and he stole too then without knowing it himself for how can it be stealing if one picks it up and do you know he is an old believer or rather a dissenter there have been wanderers in his family and he was for two years in his village under the spiritual guidance of a certain elder i learnt all this from nikolay and from his fellow villagers and what s more he wanted to run into the wilderness he was full of fervour prayed at night read the old books the true ones and read himself crazy a religious sect translator s note petersburg had a great effect upon him especially the women and the wine he responds to everything and he forgot the elder and all that i learnt that an artist here took a fancy to him and used to go and see him and now this business came upon him well he was frightened he tried to hang himself he ran away how can one get over the idea the people have of russian legal proceedings the very word trial frightens some of them whose fault is it we shall see what the new juries will do god grant they do good well in prison it seems he remembered the venerable elder the bible too made its appearance again do you know rodion romanovitch the force of the word suffering among some of these people it s not a question of suffering for someone s benefit but simply one must suffer if they suffer at the hands of the authorities so much the better in my time there was a very meek and mild prisoner who spent a whole year in prison always reading his bible on the stove at night and he read himself crazy and so crazy do you know that one day apropos of nothing he seized a brick and flung it at the governor though he had done him no harm and the way he threw it too aimed it a yard on one side on purpose for fear of hurting him well we know what happens to a prisoner who assaults an officer with a weapon so he took his suffering so i suspect now that nikolay wants to take his suffering or something of the sort i know it for certain from facts indeed only he doesn t know that i know what you don t admit that there are such fantastic people among the peasants lots of them the elder now has begun influencing him especially since he tried to hang himself but he ll come and tell me all himself you think he ll hold out wait a bit he ll take his words back i am waiting from hour to hour for him to come and abjure his evidence i have come to like that nikolay and am studying him in detail and what do you think he he he answered me very plausibly on some points he obviously had collected some evidence and prepared himself cleverly but on other points he is simply at sea knows nothing and doesn t even suspect that he doesn t know no rodion romanovitch nikolay doesn t come in this is a fantastic gloomy business a modern case an incident of to day when the heart of man is troubled when the phrase is quoted that blood renews when comfort is preached as the aim of life here we have bookish dreams a heart unhinged by theories here we see resolution in the first stage but resolution of a special kind he resolved to do it like jumping over a precipice or from a bell tower and his legs shook as he went to the crime he forgot to shut the door after him and murdered two people for a theory he committed the murder and couldn t take the money and what he did manage to snatch up he hid under a stone it wasn t enough for him to suffer agony behind the door while they battered at the door and rung the bell no he had to go to the empty lodging half delirious to recall the bell ringing he wanted to feel the cold shiver over again well that we grant was through illness but consider this he is a murderer but looks upon himself as an honest man despises others poses as injured innocence no that s not the work of a nikolay my dear rodion romanovitch all that had been said before had sounded so like a recantation that these words were too great a shock raskolnikov shuddered as though he had been stabbed then who then is the murderer he asked in a breathless voice unable to restrain himself porfiry petrovitch sank back in his chair as though he were amazed at the question who is the murderer he repeated as though unable to believe his ears why you rodion romanovitch you are the murderer he added almost in a whisper in a voice of genuine conviction raskolnikov leapt from the sofa stood up for a few seconds and sat down again without uttering a word his face twitched convulsively your lip is twitching just as it did before porfiry petrovitch observed almost sympathetically you ve been misunderstanding me i think rodion romanovitch he added after a brief pause that s why you are so surprised i came on purpose to tell you everything and deal openly with you it was not i murdered her raskolnikov whispered like a frightened child caught in the act no it was you you rodion romanovitch and no one else porfiry whispered sternly with conviction they were both silent and the silence lasted strangely long about ten minutes raskolnikov put his elbow on the table and passed his fingers through his hair porfiry petrovitch sat quietly waiting suddenly raskolnikov looked scornfully at porfiry you are at your old tricks again porfiry petrovitch your old method again i wonder you don t get sick of it oh stop that what does that matter now it would be a different matter if there were witnesses present but we are whispering alone you see yourself that i have not come to chase and capture you like a hare whether you confess it or not is nothing to me now for myself i am convinced without it if so what did you come for raskolnikov asked irritably i ask you the same question again if you consider me guilty why don t you take me to prison oh that s your question i will answer you point for point in the first place to arrest you so directly is not to my interest how so if you are convinced you ought ach what if i am convinced that s only my dream for the time why should i put you in safety you know that s it since you ask me to do it if i confront you with that workman for instance and you say to him were you drunk or not who saw me with you i simply took you to be drunk and you were drunk too well what could i answer especially as your story is a more likely one than his for there s nothing but psychology to support his evidence that s almost unseemly with his ugly mug while you hit the mark exactly for the rascal is an inveterate drunkard and notoriously so and i have myself admitted candidly several times already that that psychology can be taken in two ways and that the second way is stronger and looks far more probable and that apart from that i have as yet nothing against you and though i shall put you in prison and indeed have come quite contrary to etiquette to inform you of it beforehand yet i tell you frankly also contrary to etiquette that it won t be to my advantage well secondly i ve come to you because yes yes secondly raskolnikov was listening breathless because as i told you just now i consider i owe you an explanation i don t want you to look upon me as a monster as i have a genuine liking for you you may believe me or not and in the third place i ve come to you with a direct and open proposition that you should surrender and confess it will be infinitely more to your advantage and to my advantage too for my task will be done well is this open on my part or not raskolnikov thought a minute listen porfiry petrovitch you said just now you have nothing but psychology to go on yet now you ve gone on mathematics well what if you are mistaken yourself now no rodion romanovitch i am not mistaken i have a little fact even then providence sent it me what little fact i won t tell you what rodion romanovitch and in any case i haven t the right to put it off any longer i must arrest you so think it over it makes no difference to me now and so i speak only for your sake believe me it will be better rodion romanovitch raskolnikov smiled malignantly that s not simply ridiculous it s positively shameless why even if i were guilty which i don t admit what reason should i have to confess when you tell me yourself that i shall be in greater safety in prison ah rodion romanovitch don t put too much faith in words perhaps prison will not be altogether a restful place that s only theory and my theory and what authority am i for you perhaps too even now i am hiding something from you i can t lay bare everything he he and how can you ask what advantage don t you know how it would lessen your sentence you would be confessing at a moment when another man has taken the crime on himself and so has muddled the whole case consider that i swear before god that i will so arrange that your confession shall come as a complete surprise we will make a clean sweep of all these psychological points of a suspicion against you so that your crime will appear to have been something like an aberration for in truth it was an aberration i am an honest man rodion romanovitch and will keep my word raskolnikov maintained a mournful silence and let his head sink dejectedly he pondered a long while and at last smiled again but his smile was sad and gentle no he said apparently abandoning all attempt to keep up appearances with porfiry it s not worth it i don t care about lessening the sentence that s just what i was afraid of porfiry cried warmly and as it seemed involuntarily that s just what i feared that you wouldn t care about the mitigation of sentence raskolnikov looked sadly and expressively at him ah don t disdain life porfiry went on you have a great deal of it still before you how can you say you don t want a mitigation of sentence you are an impatient fellow a great deal of what lies before me of life what sort of prophet are you do you know much about it seek and ye shall find this may be god s means for bringing you to him and it s not for ever the bondage the time will be shortened laughed raskolnikov why is it the bourgeois disgrace you are afraid of it may be that you are afraid of it without knowing it because you are young but anyway you shouldn t be afraid of giving yourself up and confessing ach hang it raskolnikov whispered with loathing and contempt as though he did not want to speak aloud he got up again as though he meant to go away but sat down again in evident despair hang it if you like you ve lost faith and you think that i am grossly flattering you but how long has your life been how much do you understand you made up a theory and then were ashamed that it broke down and turned out to be not at all original it turned out something base that s true but you are not hopelessly base by no means so base at least you didn t deceive yourself for long you went straight to the furthest point at one bound how do i regard you i regard you as one of those men who would stand and smile at their torturer while he cuts their entrails out if only they have found faith or god find it and you will live you have long needed a change of air suffering too is a good thing suffer maybe nikolay is right in wanting to suffer i know you don t believe in it but don t be over wise fling yourself straight into life without deliberation don t be afraid the flood will bear you to the bank and set you safe on your feet again what bank how can i tell i only believe that you have long life before you i know that you take all my words now for a set speech prepared beforehand but maybe you will remember them after they may be of use some time that s why i speak it s as well that you only killed the old woman if you d invented another theory you might perhaps have done something a thousand times more hideous you ought to thank god perhaps how do you know perhaps god is saving you for something but keep a good heart and have less fear are you afraid of the great expiation before you no it would be shameful to be afraid of it since you have taken such a step you must harden your heart there is justice in it you must fulfil the demands of justice i know that you don t believe it but indeed life will bring you through you will live it down in time what you need now is fresh air fresh air fresh air raskolnikov positively started but who are you what prophet are you from the height of what majestic calm do you proclaim these words of wisdom who am i i am a man with nothing to hope for that s all a man perhaps of feeling and sympathy maybe of some knowledge too but my day is over but you are a different matter there is life waiting for you though who knows maybe your life too will pass off in smoke and come to nothing come what does it matter that you will pass into another class of men it s not comfort you regret with your heart what of it that perhaps no one will see you for so long it s not time but yourself that will decide that be the sun and all will see you the sun has before all to be the sun why are you smiling again at my being such a schiller i bet you re imagining that i am trying to get round you by flattery well perhaps i am he he he perhaps you d better not believe my word perhaps you d better never believe it altogether i m made that way i confess it but let me add you can judge for yourself i think how far i am a base sort of man and how far i am honest when do you mean to arrest me well i can let you walk about another day or two think it over my dear fellow and pray to god it s more in your interest believe me and what if i run away asked raskolnikov with a strange smile no you won t run away a peasant would run away a fashionable dissenter would run away the flunkey of another man s thought for you ve only to show him the end of your little finger and he ll be ready to believe in anything for the rest of his life but you ve ceased to believe in your theory already what will you run away with and what would you do in hiding it would be hateful and difficult for you and what you need more than anything in life is a definite position an atmosphere to suit you and what sort of atmosphere would you have if you ran away you d come back to yourself you can t get on without us and if i put you in prison say you ve been there a month or two or three remember my word you ll confess of yourself and perhaps to your own surprise you won t know an hour beforehand that you are coming with a confession i am convinced that you will decide to take your suffering you don t believe my words now but you ll come to it of yourself for suffering rodion romanovitch is a great thing never mind my having grown fat i know all the same don t laugh at it there s an idea in suffering nokolay is right no you won t run away rodion romanovitch raskolnikov got up and took his cap porfiry petrovitch also rose are you going for a walk the evening will be fine if only we don t have a storm though it would be a good thing to freshen the air he too took his cap porfiry petrovitch please don t take up the notion that i have confessed to you to day raskolnikov pronounced with sullen insistence you re a strange man and i have listened to you from simple curiosity but i have admitted nothing remember that oh i know that i ll remember look at him he s trembling don t be uneasy my dear fellow have it your own way walk about a bit you won t be able to walk too far if anything happens i have one request to make of you he added dropping his voice it s an awkward one but important if anything were to happen though indeed i don t believe in it and think you quite incapable of it yet in case you were taken during these forty or fifty hours with the notion of putting an end to the business in some other way in some fantastic fashion laying hands on yourself it s an absurd proposition but you must forgive me for it do leave a brief but precise note only two lines and mention the stone it will be more generous come till we meet good thoughts and sound decisions to you porfiry went out stooping and avoiding looking at raskolnikov the latter went to the window and waited with irritable impatience till he calculated that porfiry had reached the street and moved away then he too went hurriedly out of the room chapter iii he hurried to svidrigailov s what he had to hope from that man he did not know but that man had some hidden power over him having once recognised this he could not rest and now the time had come on the way one question particularly worried him had svidrigailov been to porfiry s as far as he could judge he would swear to it that he had not he pondered again and again went over porfiry s visit no he hadn t been of course he hadn t but if he had not been yet would he go meanwhile for the present he fancied he couldn t why he could not have explained but if he could he would not have wasted much thought over it at the moment it all worried him and at the same time he could not attend to it strange to say none would have believed it perhaps but he only felt a faint vague anxiety about his immediate future another much more important anxiety tormented him it concerned himself but in a different more vital way moreover he was conscious of immense moral fatigue though his mind was working better that morning than it had done of late and was it worth while after all that had happened to contend with these new trivial difficulties was it worth while for instance to manoeuvre that svidrigailov should not go to porfiry s was it worth while to investigate to ascertain the facts to waste time over anyone like svidrigailov oh how sick he was of it all and yet he was hastening to svidrigailov could he be expecting something new from him information or means of escape men will catch at straws was it destiny or some instinct bringing them together perhaps it was only fatigue despair perhaps it was not svidrigailov but some other whom he needed and svidrigailov had simply presented himself by chance sonia but what should he go to sonia for now to beg her tears again he was afraid of sonia too sonia stood before him as an irrevocable sentence he must go his own way or hers at that moment especially he did not feel equal to seeing her no would it not be better to try svidrigailov and he could not help inwardly owning that he had long felt that he must see him for some reason but what could they have in common their very evil doing could not be of the same kind the man moreover was very unpleasant evidently depraved undoubtedly cunning and deceitful possibly malignant such stories were told about him it is true he was befriending katerina ivanovna s children but who could tell with what motive and what it meant the man always had some design some project there was another thought which had been continually hovering of late about raskolnikov s mind and causing him great uneasiness it was so painful that he made distinct efforts to get rid of it he sometimes thought that svidrigailov was dogging his footsteps svidrigailov had found out his secret and had had designs on dounia what if he had them still wasn t it practically certain that he had and what if having learnt his secret and so having gained power over him he were to use it as a weapon against dounia this idea sometimes even tormented his dreams but it had never presented itself so vividly to him as on his way to svidrigailov the very thought moved him to gloomy rage to begin with this would transform everything even his own position he would have at once to confess his secret to dounia would he have to give himself up perhaps to prevent dounia from taking some rash step the letter this morning dounia had received a letter from whom could she get letters in petersburg luzhin perhaps it s true razumihin was there to protect her but razumihin knew nothing of the position perhaps it was his duty to tell razumihin he thought of it with repugnance in any case he must see svidrigailov as soon as possible he decided finally thank god the details of the interview were of little consequence if only he could get at the root of the matter but if svidrigailov were capable if he were intriguing against dounia then raskolnikov was so exhausted by what he had passed through that month that he could only decide such questions in one way then i shall kill him he thought in cold despair a sudden anguish oppressed his heart he stood still in the middle of the street and began looking about to see where he was and which way he was going he found himself in x prospect thirty or forty paces from the hay market through which he had come the whole second storey of the house on the left was used as a tavern all the windows were wide open judging from the figures moving at the windows the rooms were full to overflowing there were sounds of singing of clarionet and violin and the boom of a turkish drum he could hear women shrieking he was about to turn back wondering why he had come to the x prospect when suddenly at one of the end windows he saw svidrigailov sitting at a tea table right in the open window with a pipe in his mouth raskolnikov was dreadfully taken aback almost terrified svidrigailov was silently watching and scrutinising him and what struck raskolnikov at once seemed to be meaning to get up and slip away unobserved raskolnikov at once pretended not to have seen him but to be looking absent mindedly away while he watched him out of the corner of his eye his heart was beating violently yet it was evident that svidrigailov did not want to be seen he took the pipe out of his mouth and was on the point of concealing himself but as he got up and moved back his chair he seemed to have become suddenly aware that raskolnikov had seen him and was watching him what had passed between them was much the same as what happened at their first meeting in raskolnikov s room a sly smile came into svidrigailov s face and grew broader and broader each knew that he was seen and watched by the other at last svidrigailov broke into a loud laugh well well come in if you want me i am here he shouted from the window raskolnikov went up into the tavern he found svidrigailov in a tiny back room adjoining the saloon in which merchants clerks and numbers of people of all sorts were drinking tea at twenty little tables to the desperate bawling of a chorus of singers the click of billiard balls could be heard in the distance on the table before svidrigailov stood an open bottle and a glass half full of champagne in the room he found also a boy with a little hand organ a healthy looking red cheeked girl of eighteen wearing a tucked up striped skirt and a tyrolese hat with ribbons in spite of the chorus in the other room she was singing some servants hall song in a rather husky contralto to the accompaniment of the organ come that s enough svidrigailov stopped her at raskolnikov s entrance the girl at once broke off and stood waiting respectfully she had sung her guttural rhymes too with a serious and respectful expression in her face hey philip a glass shouted svidrigailov i won t drink anything said raskolnikov as you like i didn t mean it for you drink katia i don t want anything more to day you can go he poured her out a full glass and laid down a yellow note katia drank off her glass of wine as women do without putting it down in twenty gulps took the note and kissed svidrigailov s hand which he allowed quite seriously she went out of the room and the boy trailed after her with the organ both had been brought in from the street svidrigailov had not been a week in petersburg but everything about him was already so to speak on a patriarchal footing the waiter philip was by now an old friend and very obsequious the door leading to the saloon had a lock on it svidrigailov was at home in this room and perhaps spent whole days in it the tavern was dirty and wretched not even second rate i was going to see you and looking for you raskolnikov began but i don t know what made me turn from the hay market into the x prospect just now i never take this turning i turn to the right from the hay market and this isn t the way to you i simply turned and here you are it is strange why don t you say at once it s a miracle because it may be only chance oh that s the way with all you folk laughed svidrigailov you won t admit it even if you do inwardly believe it a miracle here you say that it may be only chance and what cowards they all are here about having an opinion of their own you can t fancy rodion romanovitch i don t mean you you have an opinion of your own and are not afraid to have it that s how it was you attracted my curiosity nothing else well that s enough you know svidrigailov was obviously exhilarated but only slightly so he had not had more than half a glass of wine i fancy you came to see me before you knew that i was capable of having what you call an opinion of my own observed raskolnikov oh well it was a different matter everyone has his own plans and apropos of the miracle let me tell you that i think you have been asleep for the last two or three days i told you of this tavern myself there is no miracle in your coming straight here i explained the way myself told you where it was and the hours you could find me here do you remember i don t remember answered raskolnikov with surprise i believe you i told you twice the address has been stamped mechanically on your memory you turned this way mechanically and yet precisely according to the direction though you are not aware of it when i told you then i hardly hoped you understood me you give yourself away too much rodion romanovitch and another thing i m convinced there are lots of people in petersburg who talk to themselves as they walk this is a town of crazy people if only we had scientific men doctors lawyers and philosophers might make most valuable investigations in petersburg each in his own line there are few places where there are so many gloomy strong and queer influences on the soul of man as in petersburg the mere influences of climate mean so much and it s the administrative centre of all russia and its character must be reflected on the whole country but that is neither here nor there now the point is that i have several times watched you you walk out of your house holding your head high twenty paces from home you let it sink and fold your hands behind your back you look and evidently see nothing before nor beside you at last you begin moving your lips and talking to yourself and sometimes you wave one hand and declaim and at last stand still in the middle of the road that s not at all the thing someone may be watching you besides me and it won t do you any good it s nothing really to do with me and i can t cure you but of course you understand me do you know that i am being followed asked raskolnikov looking inquisitively at him no i know nothing about it said svidrigailov seeming surprised well then let us leave me alone raskolnikov muttered frowning very good let us leave you alone you had better tell me if you come here to drink and directed me twice to come here to you why did you hide and try to get away just now when i looked at the window from the street i saw it he he and why was it you lay on your sofa with closed eyes and pretended to be asleep though you were wide awake while i stood in your doorway i saw it i may have had reasons you know that yourself and i may have had my reasons though you don t know them raskolnikov dropped his right elbow on the table leaned his chin in the fingers of his right hand and stared intently at svidrigailov for a full minute he scrutinised his face which had impressed him before it was a strange face like a mask white and red with bright red lips with a flaxen beard and still thick flaxen hair his eyes were somehow too blue and their expression somehow too heavy and fixed there was something awfully unpleasant in that handsome face which looked so wonderfully young for his age svidrigailov was smartly dressed in light summer clothes and was particularly dainty in his linen he wore a huge ring with a precious stone in it have i got to bother myself about you too now said raskolnikov suddenly coming with nervous impatience straight to the point even though perhaps you are the most dangerous man if you care to injure me i don t want to put myself out any more i will show you at once that i don t prize myself as you probably think i do i ve come to tell you at once that if you keep to your former intentions with regard to my sister and if you think to derive any benefit in that direction from what has been discovered of late i will kill you before you get me locked up you can reckon on my word you know that i can keep it and in the second place if you want to tell me anything for i keep fancying all this time that you have something to tell me make haste and tell it for time is precious and very likely it will soon be too late why in such haste asked svidrigailov looking at him curiously everyone has his plans raskolnikov answered gloomily and impatiently you urged me yourself to frankness just now and at the first question you refuse to answer svidrigailov observed with a smile you keep fancying that i have aims of my own and so you look at me with suspicion of course it s perfectly natural in your position but though i should like to be friends with you i shan t trouble myself to convince you of the contrary the game isn t worth the candle and i wasn t intending to talk to you about anything special what did you want me for then it was you who came hanging about me why simply as an interesting subject for observation i liked the fantastic nature of your position that s what it was besides you are the brother of a person who greatly interested me and from that person i had in the past heard a very great deal about you from which i gathered that you had a great influence over her isn t that enough ha ha ha still i must admit that your question is rather complex and is difficult for me to answer here you for instance have come to me not only for a definite object but for the sake of hearing something new isn t that so isn t that so persisted svidrigailov with a sly smile well can t you fancy then that i too on my way here in the train was reckoning on you on your telling me something new and on my making some profit out of you you see what rich men we are what profit could you make how can i tell you how do i know you see in what a tavern i spend all my time and it s my enjoyment that s to say it s no great enjoyment but one must sit somewhere that poor katia now you saw her if only i had been a glutton now a club gourmand but you see i can eat this he pointed to a little table in the corner where the remnants of a terrible looking beef steak and potatoes lay on a tin dish have you dined by the way i ve had something and want nothing more i don t drink for instance at all except for champagne i never touch anything and not more than a glass of that all the evening and even that is enough to make my head ache i ordered it just now to wind myself up for i am just going off somewhere and you see me in a peculiar state of mind that was why i hid myself just now like a schoolboy for i was afraid you would hinder me but i believe he pulled out his watch i can spend an hour with you it s half past four now if only i d been something a landowner a father a cavalry officer a photographer a journalist i am nothing no specialty and sometimes i am positively bored i really thought you would tell me something new but what are you and why have you come here what am i you know a gentleman i served for two years in the cavalry then i knocked about here in petersburg then i married marfa petrovna and lived in the country there you have my biography you are a gambler i believe no a poor sort of gambler a card sharper not a gambler you have been a card sharper then yes i ve been a card sharper too didn t you get thrashed sometimes it did happen why why you might have challenged them altogether it must have been lively i won t contradict you and besides i am no hand at philosophy i confess that i hastened here for the sake of the women as soon as you buried marfa petrovna quite so svidrigailov smiled with engaging candour what of it you seem to find something wrong in my speaking like that about women you ask whether i find anything wrong in vice vice oh that s what you are after but i ll answer you in order first about women in general you know i am fond of talking tell me what should i restrain myself for why should i give up women since i have a passion for them it s an occupation anyway so you hope for nothing here but vice oh very well for vice then you insist on its being vice but anyway i like a direct question in this vice at least there is something permanent founded indeed upon nature and not dependent on fantasy something present in the blood like an ever burning ember for ever setting one on fire and maybe not to be quickly extinguished even with years you ll agree it s an occupation of a sort that s nothing to rejoice at it s a disease and a dangerous one oh that s what you think is it i agree that it is a disease like everything that exceeds moderation and of course in this one must exceed moderation but in the first place everybody does so in one way or another and in the second place of course one ought to be moderate and prudent however mean it may be but what am i to do if i hadn t this i might have to shoot myself i am ready to admit that a decent man ought to put up with being bored but yet and could you shoot yourself oh come svidrigailov parried with disgust please don t speak of it he added hurriedly and with none of the bragging tone he had shown in all the previous conversation his face quite changed i admit it s an unpardonable weakness but i can t help it i am afraid of death and i dislike its being talked of do you know that i am to a certain extent a mystic ah the apparitions of marfa petrovna do they still go on visiting you oh don t talk of them there have been no more in petersburg confound them he cried with an air of irritation let s rather talk of that though h m i have not much time and can t stay long with you it s a pity i should have found plenty to tell you what s your engagement a woman yes a woman a casual incident no that s not what i want to talk of and the hideousness the filthiness of all your surroundings doesn t that affect you have you lost the strength to stop yourself and do you pretend to strength too he he he you surprised me just now rodion romanovitch though i knew beforehand it would be so you preach to me about vice and aesthetics you a schiller you an idealist of course that s all as it should be and it would be surprising if it were not so yet it is strange in reality ah what a pity i have no time for you re a most interesting type and by the way are you fond of schiller i am awfully fond of him but what a braggart you are raskolnikov said with some disgust upon my word i am not answered svidrigailov laughing however i won t dispute it let me be a braggart why not brag if it hurts no one i spent seven years in the country with marfa petrovna so now when i come across an intelligent person like you intelligent and highly interesting i am simply glad to talk and besides i ve drunk that half glass of champagne and it s gone to my head a little and besides there s a certain fact that has wound me up tremendously but about that i will keep quiet where are you off to he asked in alarm raskolnikov had begun getting up he felt oppressed and stifled and as it were ill at ease at having come here he felt convinced that svidrigailov was the most worthless scoundrel on the face of the earth a ach sit down stay a little svidrigailov begged let them bring you some tea anyway stay a little i won t talk nonsense about myself i mean i ll tell you something if you like i ll tell you how a woman tried to save me as you would call it it will be an answer to your first question indeed for the woman was your sister may i tell you it will help to spend the time tell me but i trust that you oh don t be uneasy besides even in a worthless low fellow like me avdotya romanovna can only excite the deepest respect chapter iv you know perhaps yes i told you myself began svidrigailov that i was in the debtors prison here for an immense sum and had not any expectation of being able to pay it there s no need to go into particulars how marfa petrovna bought me out do you know to what a point of insanity a woman can sometimes love she was an honest woman and very sensible although completely uneducated would you believe that this honest and jealous woman after many scenes of hysterics and reproaches condescended to enter into a kind of contract with me which she kept throughout our married life she was considerably older than i and besides she always kept a clove or something in her mouth there was so much swinishness in my soul and honesty too of a sort as to tell her straight out that i couldn t be absolutely faithful to her this confession drove her to frenzy but yet she seems in a way to have liked my brutal frankness she thought it showed i was unwilling to deceive her if i warned her like this beforehand and for a jealous woman you know that s the first consideration after many tears an unwritten contract was drawn up between us first that i would never leave marfa petrovna and would always be her husband secondly that i would never absent myself without her permission thirdly that i would never set up a permanent mistress fourthly in return for this marfa petrovna gave me a free hand with the maidservants but only with her secret knowledge fifthly god forbid my falling in love with a woman of our class sixthly in case i which god forbid should be visited by a great serious passion i was bound to reveal it to marfa petrovna on this last score however marfa petrovna was fairly at ease she was a sensible woman and so she could not help looking upon me as a dissolute profligate incapable of real love but a sensible woman and a jealous woman are two very different things and that s where the trouble came in but to judge some people impartially we must renounce certain preconceived opinions and our habitual attitude to the ordinary people about us i have reason to have faith in your judgment rather than in anyone s perhaps you have already heard a great deal that was ridiculous and absurd about marfa petrovna she certainly had some very ridiculous ways but i tell you frankly that i feel really sorry for the innumerable woes of which i was the cause well and that s enough i think by way of a decorous oraison funebre for the most tender wife of a most tender husband when we quarrelled i usually held my tongue and did not irritate her and that gentlemanly conduct rarely failed to attain its object it influenced her it pleased her indeed these were times when she was positively proud of me but your sister she couldn t put up with anyway and however she came to risk taking such a beautiful creature into her house as a governess my explanation is that marfa petrovna was an ardent and impressionable woman and simply fell in love herself literally fell in love with your sister well little wonder look at avdotya romanovna i saw the danger at the first glance and what do you think i resolved not to look at her even but avdotya romanovna herself made the first step would you believe it would you believe it too that marfa petrovna was positively angry with me at first for my persistent silence about your sister for my careless reception of her continual adoring praises of avdotya romanovna i don t know what it was she wanted well of course marfa petrovna told avdotya romanovna every detail about me she had the unfortunate habit of telling literally everyone all our family secrets and continually complaining of me how could she fail to confide in such a delightful new friend i expect they talked of nothing else but me and no doubt avdotya romanovna heard all those dark mysterious rumours that were current about me i don t mind betting that you too have heard something of the sort already i have luzhin charged you with having caused the death of a child is that true don t refer to those vulgar tales i beg said svidrigailov with disgust and annoyance if you insist on wanting to know about all that idiocy i will tell you one day but now i was told too about some footman of yours in the country whom you treated badly i beg you to drop the subject svidrigailov interrupted again with obvious impatience was that the footman who came to you after death to fill your pipe you told me about it yourself raskolnikov felt more and more irritated svidrigailov looked at him attentively and raskolnikov fancied he caught a flash of spiteful mockery in that look but svidrigailov restrained himself and answered very civilly yes it was i see that you too are extremely interested and shall feel it my duty to satisfy your curiosity at the first opportunity upon my soul i see that i really might pass for a romantic figure with some people judge how grateful i must be to marfa petrovna for having repeated to avdotya romanovna such mysterious and interesting gossip about me i dare not guess what impression it made on her but in any case it worked in my interests with all avdotya romanovna s natural aversion and in spite of my invariably gloomy and repellent aspect she did at least feel pity for me pity for a lost soul and if once a girl s heart is moved to pity it s more dangerous than anything she is bound to want to save him to bring him to his senses and lift him up and draw him to nobler aims and restore him to new life and usefulness well we all know how far such dreams can go i saw at once that the bird was flying into the cage of herself and i too made ready i think you are frowning rodion romanovitch there s no need as you know it all ended in smoke hang it all what a lot i am drinking do you know i always from the very beginning regretted that it wasn t your sister s fate to be born in the second or third century a d as the daughter of a reigning prince or some governor or pro consul in asia minor she would undoubtedly have been one of those who would endure martyrdom and would have smiled when they branded her bosom with hot pincers and she would have gone to it of herself and in the fourth or fifth century she would have walked away into the egyptian desert and would have stayed there thirty years living on roots and ecstasies and visions she is simply thirsting to face some torture for someone and if she can t get her torture she ll throw herself out of a window i ve heard something of a mr razumihin he s said to be a sensible fellow his surname suggests it indeed he s probably a divinity student well he d better look after your sister i believe i understand her and i am proud of it but at the beginning of an acquaintance as you know one is apt to be more heedless and stupid one doesn t see clearly hang it all why is she so handsome it s not my fault in fact it began on my side with a most irresistible physical desire avdotya romanovna is awfully chaste incredibly and phenomenally so take note i tell you this about your sister as a fact she is almost morbidly chaste in spite of her broad intelligence and it will stand in her way there happened to be a girl in the house then parasha a black eyed wench whom i had never seen before she had just come from another village very pretty but incredibly stupid she burst into tears wailed so that she could be heard all over the place and caused scandal one day after dinner avdotya romanovna followed me into an avenue in the garden and with flashing eyes insisted on my leaving poor parasha alone it was almost our first conversation by ourselves i of course was only too pleased to obey her wishes tried to appear disconcerted embarrassed in fact played my part not badly then came interviews mysterious conversations exhortations entreaties supplications even tears would you believe it even tears think what the passion for propaganda will bring some girls to i of course threw it all on my destiny posed as hungering and thirsting for light and finally resorted to the most powerful weapon in the subjection of the female heart a weapon which never fails one it s the well known resource flattery nothing in the world is harder than speaking the truth and nothing easier than flattery if there s the hundredth part of a false note in speaking the truth it leads to a discord and that leads to trouble but if all to the last note is false in flattery it is just as agreeable and is heard not without satisfaction it may be a coarse satisfaction but still a satisfaction and however coarse the flattery at least half will be sure to seem true that s so for all stages of development and classes of society a vestal virgin might be seduced by flattery i can never remember without laughter how i once seduced a lady who was devoted to her husband her children and her principles what fun it was and how little trouble and the lady really had principles of her own anyway all my tactics lay in simply being utterly annihilated and prostrate before her purity i flattered her shamelessly and as soon as i succeeded in getting a pressure of the hand even a glance from her i would reproach myself for having snatched it by force and would declare that she had resisted so that i could never have gained anything but for my being so unprincipled i maintained that she was so innocent that she could not foresee my treachery and yielded to me unconsciously unawares and so on in fact i triumphed while my lady remained firmly convinced that she was innocent chaste and faithful to all her duties and obligations and had succumbed quite by accident and how angry she was with me when i explained to her at last that it was my sincere conviction that she was just as eager as i poor marfa petrovna was awfully weak on the side of flattery and if i had only cared to i might have had all her property settled on me during her lifetime i am drinking an awful lot of wine now and talking too much i hope you won t be angry if i mention now that i was beginning to produce the same effect on avdotya romanovna but i was stupid and impatient and spoiled it all avdotya romanovna had several times and one time in particular been greatly displeased by the expression of my eyes would you believe it there was sometimes a light in them which frightened her and grew stronger and stronger and more unguarded till it was hateful to her no need to go into detail but we parted there i acted stupidly again i fell to jeering in the coarsest way at all such propaganda and efforts to convert me parasha came on to the scene again and not she alone in fact there was a tremendous to do ah rodion romanovitch if you could only see how your sister s eyes can flash sometimes never mind my being drunk at this moment and having had a whole glass of wine i am speaking the truth i assure you that this glance has haunted my dreams the very rustle of her dress was more than i could stand at last i really began to think that i might become epileptic i could never have believed that i could be moved to such a frenzy it was essential indeed to be reconciled but by then it was impossible and imagine what i did then to what a pitch of stupidity a man can be brought by frenzy never undertake anything in a frenzy rodion romanovitch i reflected that avdotya romanovna was after all a beggar ach excuse me that s not the word but does it matter if it expresses the meaning that she lived by her work that she had her mother and you to keep ach hang it you are frowning again and i resolved to offer her all my money thirty thousand roubles i could have realised then if she would run away with me here to petersburg of course i should have vowed eternal love rapture and so on do you know i was so wild about her at that time that if she had told me to poison marfa petrovna or to cut her throat and to marry herself it would have been done at once but it ended in the catastrophe of which you know already you can fancy how frantic i was when i heard that marfa petrovna had got hold of that scoundrelly attorney luzhin and had almost made a match between them which would really have been just the same thing as i was proposing wouldn t it wouldn t it i notice that you ve begun to be very attentive you interesting young man svidrigailov struck the table with his fist impatiently he was flushed raskolnikov saw clearly that the glass or glass and a half of champagne that he had sipped almost unconsciously was affecting him and he resolved to take advantage of the opportunity he felt very suspicious of svidrigailov well after what you have said i am fully convinced that you have come to petersburg with designs on my sister he said directly to svidrigailov in order to irritate him further oh nonsense said svidrigailov seeming to rouse himself why i told you besides your sister can t endure me yes i am certain that she can t but that s not the point are you so sure that she can t svidrigailov screwed up his eyes and smiled mockingly you are right she doesn t love me but you can never be sure of what has passed between husband and wife or lover and mistress there s always a little corner which remains a secret to the world and is only known to those two will you answer for it that avdotya romanovna regarded me with aversion from some words you ve dropped i notice that you still have designs and of course evil ones on dounia and mean to carry them out promptly what have i dropped words like that svidrigailov asked in naive dismay taking not the slightest notice of the epithet bestowed on his designs why you are dropping them even now why are you so frightened what are you so afraid of now me afraid afraid of you you have rather to be afraid of me cher ami but what nonsense i ve drunk too much though i see that i was almost saying too much again damn the wine hi there water he snatched up the champagne bottle and flung it without ceremony out of the window philip brought the water that s all nonsense said svidrigailov wetting a towel and putting it to his head but i can answer you in one word and annihilate all your suspicions do you know that i am going to get married you told me so before did i i ve forgotten but i couldn t have told you so for certain for i had not even seen my betrothed i only meant to but now i really have a betrothed and it s a settled thing and if it weren t that i have business that can t be put off i would have taken you to see them at once for i should like to ask your advice ach hang it only ten minutes left see look at the watch but i must tell you for it s an interesting story my marriage in its own way where are you off to going again no i m not going away now not at all we shall see i ll take you there i ll show you my betrothed only not now for you ll soon have to be off you have to go to the right and i to the left do you know that madame resslich the woman i am lodging with now eh i know what you re thinking that she s the woman whose girl they say drowned herself in the winter come are you listening she arranged it all for me you re bored she said you want something to fill up your time for you know i am a gloomy depressed person do you think i m light hearted no i m gloomy i do no harm but sit in a corner without speaking a word for three days at a time and that resslich is a sly hussy i tell you i know what she has got in her mind she thinks i shall get sick of it abandon my wife and depart and she ll get hold of her and make a profit out of her in our class of course or higher she told me the father was a broken down retired official who has been sitting in a chair for the last three years with his legs paralysed the mamma she said was a sensible woman there is a son serving in the provinces but he doesn t help there is a daughter who is married but she doesn t visit them and they ve two little nephews on their hands as though their own children were not enough and they ve taken from school their youngest daughter a girl who ll be sixteen in another month so that then she can be married she was for me we went there how funny it was i present myself a landowner a widower of a well known name with connections with a fortune what if i am fifty and she is not sixteen who thinks of that but it s fascinating isn t it it is fascinating ha ha you should have seen how i talked to the papa and mamma it was worth paying to have seen me at that moment she comes in curtseys you can fancy still in a short frock an unopened bud flushing like a sunset she had been told no doubt i don t know how you feel about female faces but to my mind these sixteen years these childish eyes shyness and tears of bashfulness are better than beauty and she is a perfect little picture too fair hair in little curls like a lamb s full little rosy lips tiny feet a charmer well we made friends i told them i was in a hurry owing to domestic circumstances and the next day that is the day before yesterday we were betrothed when i go now i take her on my knee at once and keep her there well she flushes like a sunset and i kiss her every minute her mamma of course impresses on her that this is her husband and that this must be so it s simply delicious the present betrothed condition is perhaps better than marriage here you have what is called la nature et la verite ha ha i ve talked to her twice she is far from a fool sometimes she steals a look at me that positively scorches me her face is like raphael s madonna you know the sistine madonna s face has something fantastic in it the face of mournful religious ecstasy haven t you noticed it well she s something in that line the day after we d been betrothed i bought her presents to the value of fifteen hundred roubles a set of diamonds and another of pearls and a silver dressing case as large as this with all sorts of things in it so that even my madonna s face glowed i sat her on my knee yesterday and i suppose rather too unceremoniously she flushed crimson and the tears started but she didn t want to show it we were left alone she suddenly flung herself on my neck for the first time of her own accord put her little arms round me kissed me and vowed that she would be an obedient faithful and good wife would make me happy would devote all her life every minute of her life would sacrifice everything everything and that all she asks in return is my respect and that she wants nothing nothing more from me no presents you ll admit that to hear such a confession alone from an angel of sixteen in a muslin frock with little curls with a flush of maiden shyness in her cheeks and tears of enthusiasm in her eyes is rather fascinating isn t it fascinating it s worth paying for isn t it well listen we ll go to see my betrothed only not just now the fact is this monstrous difference in age and development excites your sensuality will you really make such a marriage why of course everyone thinks of himself and he lives most gaily who knows best how to deceive himself ha ha but why are you so keen about virtue have mercy on me my good friend i am a sinful man ha ha ha but you have provided for the children of katerina ivanovna though though you had your own reasons i understand it all now i am always fond of children very fond of them laughed svidrigailov i can tell you one curious instance of it the first day i came here i visited various haunts after seven years i simply rushed at them you probably notice that i am not in a hurry to renew acquaintance with my old friends i shall do without them as long as i can do you know when i was with marfa petrovna in the country i was haunted by the thought of these places where anyone who knows his way about can find a great deal yes upon my soul the peasants have vodka the educated young people shut out from activity waste themselves in impossible dreams and visions and are crippled by theories jews have sprung up and are amassing money and all the rest give themselves up to debauchery from the first hour the town reeked of its familiar odours i chanced to be in a frightful den i like my dens dirty it was a dance so called and there was a cancan such as i never saw in my day yes there you have progress all of a sudden i saw a little girl of thirteen nicely dressed dancing with a specialist in that line with another one vis a vis her mother was sitting on a chair by the wall you can t fancy what a cancan that was the girl was ashamed blushed at last felt insulted and began to cry her partner seized her and began whirling her round and performing before her everyone laughed and i like your public even the cancan public they laughed and shouted serves her right serves her right shouldn t bring children well it s not my business whether that consoling reflection was logical or not i at once fixed on my plan sat down by the mother and began by saying that i too was a stranger and that people here were ill bred and that they couldn t distinguish decent folks and treat them with respect gave her to understand that i had plenty of money offered to take them home in my carriage i took them home and got to know them they were lodging in a miserable little hole and had only just arrived from the country she told me that she and her daughter could only regard my acquaintance as an honour i found out that they had nothing of their own and had come to town upon some legal business i proffered my services and money i learnt that they had gone to the dancing saloon by mistake believing that it was a genuine dancing class i offered to assist in the young girl s education in french and dancing my offer was accepted with enthusiasm as an honour and we are still friendly if you like we ll go and see them only not just now stop enough of your vile nasty anecdotes depraved vile sensual man schiller you are a regular schiller o la vertu va t elle se nicher but you know i shall tell you these things on purpose for the pleasure of hearing your outcries i dare say i can see i am ridiculous myself muttered raskolnikov angrily svidrigailov laughed heartily finally he called philip paid his bill and began getting up i say but i am drunk assez cause he said it s been a pleasure i should rather think it must be a pleasure cried raskolnikov getting up no doubt it is a pleasure for a worn out profligate to describe such adventures with a monstrous project of the same sort in his mind especially under such circumstances and to such a man as me it s stimulating well if you come to that svidrigailov answered scrutinising raskolnikov with some surprise if you come to that you are a thorough cynic yourself you ve plenty to make you so anyway you can understand a great deal and you can do a great deal too but enough i sincerely regret not having had more talk with you but i shan t lose sight of you only wait a bit svidrigailov walked out of the restaurant raskolnikov walked out after him svidrigailov was not however very drunk the wine had affected him for a moment but it was passing off every minute he was preoccupied with something of importance and was frowning he was apparently excited and uneasy in anticipation of something his manner to raskolnikov had changed during the last few minutes and he was ruder and more sneering every moment raskolnikov noticed all this and he too was uneasy he became very suspicious of svidrigailov and resolved to follow him they came out on to the pavement you go to the right and i to the left or if you like the other way only adieu mon plaisir may we meet again and he walked to the right towards the hay market chapter v raskolnikov walked after him what s this cried svidrigailov turning round i thought i said it means that i am not going to lose sight of you now what both stood still and gazed at one another as though measuring their strength from all your half tipsy stories raskolnikov observed harshly i am positive that you have not given up your designs on my sister but are pursuing them more actively than ever i have learnt that my sister received a letter this morning you have hardly been able to sit still all this time you may have unearthed a wife on the way but that means nothing i should like to make certain myself raskolnikov could hardly have said himself what he wanted and of what he wished to make certain upon my word i ll call the police call away again they stood for a minute facing each other at last svidrigailov s face changed having satisfied himself that raskolnikov was not frightened at his threat he assumed a mirthful and friendly air what a fellow i purposely refrained from referring to your affair though i am devoured by curiosity it s a fantastic affair i ve put it off till another time but you re enough to rouse the dead well let us go only i warn you beforehand i am only going home for a moment to get some money then i shall lock up the flat take a cab and go to spend the evening at the islands now now are you going to follow me i m coming to your lodgings not to see you but sofya semyonovna to say i m sorry not to have been at the funeral that s as you like but sofya semyonovna is not at home she has taken the three children to an old lady of high rank the patroness of some orphan asylums whom i used to know years ago i charmed the old lady by depositing a sum of money with her to provide for the three children of katerina ivanovna and subscribing to the institution as well i told her too the story of sofya semyonovna in full detail suppressing nothing it produced an indescribable effect on her that s why sofya semyonovna has been invited to call to day at the x hotel where the lady is staying for the time no matter i ll come all the same as you like it s nothing to me but i won t come with you here we are at home by the way i am convinced that you regard me with suspicion just because i have shown such delicacy and have not so far troubled you with questions you understand it struck you as extraordinary i don t mind betting it s that well it teaches one to show delicacy and to listen at doors ah that s it is it laughed svidrigailov yes i should have been surprised if you had let that pass after all that has happened ha ha though i did understand something of the pranks you had been up to and were telling sofya semyonovna about what was the meaning of it perhaps i am quite behind the times and can t understand for goodness sake explain it my dear boy expound the latest theories you couldn t have heard anything you re making it all up but i m not talking about that though i did hear something no i m talking of the way you keep sighing and groaning now the schiller in you is in revolt every moment and now you tell me not to listen at doors if that s how you feel go and inform the police that you had this mischance you made a little mistake in your theory but if you are convinced that one mustn t listen at doors but one may murder old women at one s pleasure you d better be off to america and make haste run young man there may still be time i m speaking sincerely haven t you the money i ll give you the fare i m not thinking of that at all raskolnikov interrupted with disgust i understand but don t put yourself out don t discuss it if you don t want to i understand the questions you are worrying over moral ones aren t they duties of citizen and man lay them all aside they are nothing to you now ha ha you ll say you are still a man and a citizen if so you ought not to have got into this coil it s no use taking up a job you are not fit for well you d better shoot yourself or don t you want to you seem trying to enrage me to make me leave you what a queer fellow but here we are welcome to the staircase you see that s the way to sofya semyonovna look there is no one at home don t you believe me ask kapernaumov she leaves the key with him here is madame de kapernaumov herself hey what she is rather deaf has she gone out where did you hear she is not in and won t be till late in the evening probably well come to my room you wanted to come and see me didn t you here we are madame resslich s not at home she is a woman who is always busy an excellent woman i assure you she might have been of use to you if you had been a little more sensible now see i take this five per cent bond out of the bureau see what a lot i ve got of them still this one will be turned into cash to day i mustn t waste any more time the bureau is locked the flat is locked and here we are again on the stairs shall we take a cab i m going to the islands would you like a lift i ll take this carriage ah you refuse you are tired of it come for a drive i believe it will come on to rain never mind we ll put down the hood svidrigailov was already in the carriage raskolnikov decided that his suspicions were at least for that moment unjust without answering a word he turned and walked back towards the hay market if he had only turned round on his way he might have seen svidrigailov get out not a hundred paces off dismiss the cab and walk along the pavement but he had turned the corner and could see nothing intense disgust drew him away from svidrigailov to think that i could for one instant have looked for help from that coarse brute that depraved sensualist and blackguard he cried raskolnikov s judgment was uttered too lightly and hastily there was something about svidrigailov which gave him a certain original even a mysterious character as concerned his sister raskolnikov was convinced that svidrigailov would not leave her in peace but it was too tiresome and unbearable to go on thinking and thinking about this when he was alone he had not gone twenty paces before he sank as usual into deep thought on the bridge he stood by the railing and began gazing at the water and his sister was standing close by him he met her at the entrance to the bridge but passed by without seeing her dounia had never met him like this in the street before and was struck with dismay she stood still and did not know whether to call to him or not suddenly she saw svidrigailov coming quickly from the direction of the hay market he seemed to be approaching cautiously he did not go on to the bridge but stood aside on the pavement doing all he could to avoid raskolnikov s seeing him he had observed dounia for some time and had been making signs to her she fancied he was signalling to beg her not to speak to her brother but to come to him that was what dounia did she stole by her brother and went up to svidrigailov let us make haste away svidrigailov whispered to her i don t want rodion romanovitch to know of our meeting i must tell you i ve been sitting with him in the restaurant close by where he looked me up and i had great difficulty in getting rid of him he has somehow heard of my letter to you and suspects something it wasn t you who told him of course but if not you who then well we ve turned the corner now dounia interrupted and my brother won t see us i have to tell you that i am going no further with you speak to me here you can tell it all in the street in the first place i can t say it in the street secondly you must hear sofya semyonovna too and thirdly i will show you some papers oh well if you won t agree to come with me i shall refuse to give any explanation and go away at once but i beg you not to forget that a very curious secret of your beloved brother s is entirely in my keeping dounia stood still hesitating and looked at svidrigailov with searching eyes what are you afraid of he observed quietly the town is not the country and even in the country you did me more harm than i did you have you prepared sofya semyonovna no i have not said a word to her and am not quite certain whether she is at home now but most likely she is she has buried her stepmother to day she is not likely to go visiting on such a day for the time i don t want to speak to anyone about it and i half regret having spoken to you the slightest indiscretion is as bad as betrayal in a thing like this i live there in that house we are coming to it that s the porter of our house he knows me very well you see he s bowing he sees i m coming with a lady and no doubt he has noticed your face already and you will be glad of that if you are afraid of me and suspicious excuse my putting things so coarsely i haven t a flat to myself sofya semyonovna s room is next to mine she lodges in the next flat the whole floor is let out in lodgings why are you frightened like a child am i really so terrible svidrigailov s lips were twisted in a condescending smile but he was in no smiling mood his heart was throbbing and he could scarcely breathe he spoke rather loud to cover his growing excitement but dounia did not notice this peculiar excitement she was so irritated by his remark that she was frightened of him like a child and that he was so terrible to her though i know that you are not a man of honour i am not in the least afraid of you lead the way she said with apparent composure but her face was very pale svidrigailov stopped at sonia s room allow me to inquire whether she is at home she is not how unfortunate but i know she may come quite soon if she s gone out it can only be to see a lady about the orphans their mother is dead i ve been meddling and making arrangements for them if sofya semyonovna does not come back in ten minutes i will send her to you to day if you like this is my flat these are my two rooms madame resslich my landlady has the next room now look this way i will show you my chief piece of evidence this door from my bedroom leads into two perfectly empty rooms which are to let here they are you must look into them with some attention svidrigailov occupied two fairly large furnished rooms dounia was looking about her mistrustfully but saw nothing special in the furniture or position of the rooms yet there was something to observe for instance that svidrigailov s flat was exactly between two sets of almost uninhabited apartments his rooms were not entered directly from the passage but through the landlady s two almost empty rooms unlocking a door leading out of his bedroom svidrigailov showed dounia the two empty rooms that were to let dounia stopped in the doorway not knowing what she was called to look upon but svidrigailov hastened to explain look here at this second large room notice that door it s locked by the door stands a chair the only one in the two rooms i brought it from my rooms so as to listen more conveniently just the other side of the door is sofya semyonovna s table she sat there talking to rodion romanovitch and i sat here listening on two successive evenings for two hours each time and of course i was able to learn something what do you think you listened yes i did now come back to my room we can t sit down here he brought avdotya romanovna back into his sitting room and offered her a chair he sat down at the opposite side of the table at least seven feet from her but probably there was the same glow in his eyes which had once frightened dounia so much she shuddered and once more looked about her distrustfully it was an involuntary gesture she evidently did not wish to betray her uneasiness but the secluded position of svidrigailov s lodging had suddenly struck her she wanted to ask whether his landlady at least were at home but pride kept her from asking moreover she had another trouble in her heart incomparably greater than fear for herself she was in great distress here is your letter she said laying it on the table can it be true what you write you hint at a crime committed you say by my brother you hint at it too clearly you daren t deny it now i must tell you that i d heard of this stupid story before you wrote and don t believe a word of it it s a disgusting and ridiculous suspicion i know the story and why and how it was invented you can have no proofs you promised to prove it speak but let me warn you that i don t believe you i don t believe you dounia said this speaking hurriedly and for an instant the colour rushed to her face if you didn t believe it how could you risk coming alone to my rooms why have you come simply from curiosity don t torment me speak speak there s no denying that you are a brave girl upon my word i thought you would have asked mr razumihin to escort you here but he was not with you nor anywhere near i was on the look out it s spirited of you it proves you wanted to spare rodion romanovitch but everything is divine in you about your brother what am i to say to you you ve just seen him yourself what did you think of him surely that s not the only thing you are building on no not on that but on his own words he came here on two successive evenings to see sofya semyonovna i ve shown you where they sat he made a full confession to her he is a murderer he killed an old woman a pawnbroker with whom he had pawned things himself he killed her sister too a pedlar woman called lizaveta who happened to come in while he was murdering her sister he killed them with an axe he brought with him he murdered them to rob them and he did rob them he took money and various things he told all this word for word to sofya semyonovna the only person who knows his secret but she has had no share by word or deed in the murder she was as horrified at it as you are now don t be anxious she won t betray him it cannot be muttered dounia with white lips she gasped for breath it cannot be there was not the slightest cause no sort of ground it s a lie a lie he robbed her that was the cause he took money and things it s true that by his own admission he made no use of the money or things but hid them under a stone where they are now but that was because he dared not make use of them but how could he steal rob how could he dream of it cried dounia and she jumped up from the chair why you know him and you ve seen him can he be a thief she seemed to be imploring svidrigailov she had entirely forgotten her fear there are thousands and millions of combinations and possibilities avdotya romanovna a thief steals and knows he is a scoundrel but i ve heard of a gentleman who broke open the mail who knows very likely he thought he was doing a gentlemanly thing of course i should not have believed it myself if i d been told of it as you have but i believe my own ears he explained all the causes of it to sofya semyonovna too but she did not believe her ears at first yet she believed her own eyes at last what were the causes it s a long story avdotya romanovna here s how shall i tell you a theory of a sort the same one by which i for instance consider that a single misdeed is permissible if the principal aim is right a solitary wrongdoing and hundreds of good deeds it s galling too of course for a young man of gifts and overweening pride to know that if he had for instance a paltry three thousand his whole career his whole future would be differently shaped and yet not to have that three thousand add to that nervous irritability from hunger from lodging in a hole from rags from a vivid sense of the charm of his social position and his sister s and mother s position too above all vanity pride and vanity though goodness knows he may have good qualities too i am not blaming him please don t think it besides it s not my business a special little theory came in too a theory of a sort dividing mankind you see into material and superior persons that is persons to whom the law does not apply owing to their superiority who make laws for the rest of mankind the material that is it s all right as a theory une theorie comme une autre napoleon attracted him tremendously that is what affected him was that a great many men of genius have not hesitated at wrongdoing but have overstepped the law without thinking about it he seems to have fancied that he was a genius too that is he was convinced of it for a time he has suffered a great deal and is still suffering from the idea that he could make a theory but was incapable of boldly overstepping the law and so he is not a man of genius and that s humiliating for a young man of any pride in our day especially but remorse you deny him any moral feeling then is he like that ah avdotya romanovna everything is in a muddle now not that it was ever in very good order russians in general are broad in their ideas avdotya romanovna broad like their land and exceedingly disposed to the fantastic the chaotic but it s a misfortune to be broad without a special genius do you remember what a lot of talk we had together on this subject sitting in the evenings on the terrace after supper why you used to reproach me with breadth who knows perhaps we were talking at the very time when he was lying here thinking over his plan there are no sacred traditions amongst us especially in the educated class avdotya romanovna at the best someone will make them up somehow for himself out of books or from some old chronicle but those are for the most part the learned and all old fogeys so that it would be almost ill bred in a man of society you know my opinions in general though i never blame anyone i do nothing at all i persevere in that but we ve talked of this more than once before i was so happy indeed as to interest you in my opinions you are very pale avdotya romanovna i know his theory i read that article of his about men to whom all is permitted razumihin brought it to me mr razumihin your brother s article in a magazine is there such an article i didn t know it must be interesting but where are you going avdotya romanovna i want to see sofya semyonovna dounia articulated faintly how do i go to her she has come in perhaps i must see her at once perhaps she avdotya romanovna could not finish her breath literally failed her sofya semyonovna will not be back till night at least i believe not she was to have been back at once but if not then she will not be in till quite late ah then you are lying i see you were lying lying all the time i don t believe you i don t believe you cried dounia completely losing her head almost fainting she sank on to a chair which svidrigailov made haste to give her avdotya romanovna what is it control yourself here is some water drink a little he sprinkled some water over her dounia shuddered and came to herself it has acted violently svidrigailov muttered to himself frowning avdotya romanovna calm yourself believe me he has friends we will save him would you like me to take him abroad i have money i can get a ticket in three days and as for the murder he will do all sorts of good deeds yet to atone for it calm yourself he may become a great man yet well how are you how do you feel cruel man to be able to jeer at it let me go where are you going to him where is he do you know why is this door locked we came in at that door and now it is locked when did you manage to lock it we couldn t be shouting all over the flat on such a subject i am far from jeering it s simply that i m sick of talking like this but how can you go in such a state do you want to betray him you will drive him to fury and he will give himself up let me tell you he is already being watched they are already on his track you will simply be giving him away wait a little i saw him and was talking to him just now he can still be saved wait a bit sit down let us think it over together i asked you to come in order to discuss it alone with you and to consider it thoroughly but do sit down how can you save him can he really be saved dounia sat down svidrigailov sat down beside her it all depends on you on you on you alone he begin with glowing eyes almost in a whisper and hardly able to utter the words for emotion dounia drew back from him in alarm he too was trembling all over you one word from you and he is saved i i ll save him i have money and friends i ll send him away at once i ll get a passport two passports one for him and one for me i have friends capable people if you like i ll take a passport for you for your mother what do you want with razumihin i love you too i love you beyond everything let me kiss the hem of your dress let me let me the very rustle of it is too much for me tell me do that and i ll do it i ll do everything i will do the impossible what you believe i will believe i ll do anything anything don t don t look at me like that do you know that you are killing me he was almost beginning to rave something seemed suddenly to go to his head dounia jumped up and rushed to the door open it open it she called shaking the door open it is there no one there svidrigailov got up and came to himself his still trembling lips slowly broke into an angry mocking smile there is no one at home he said quietly and emphatically the landlady has gone out and it s waste of time to shout like that you are only exciting yourself uselessly where is the key open the door at once at once base man i have lost the key and cannot find it this is an outrage cried dounia turning pale as death she rushed to the furthest corner where she made haste to barricade herself with a little table she did not scream but she fixed her eyes on her tormentor and watched every movement he made svidrigailov remained standing at the other end of the room facing her he was positively composed at least in appearance but his face was pale as before the mocking smile did not leave his face you spoke of outrage just now avdotya romanovna in that case you may be sure i ve taken measures sofya semyonovna is not at home the kapernaumovs are far away there are five locked rooms between i am at least twice as strong as you are and i have nothing to fear besides for you could not complain afterwards you surely would not be willing actually to betray your brother besides no one would believe you how should a girl have come alone to visit a solitary man in his lodgings so that even if you do sacrifice your brother you could prove nothing it is very difficult to prove an assault avdotya romanovna scoundrel whispered dounia indignantly as you like but observe i was only speaking by way of a general proposition it s my personal conviction that you are perfectly right violence is hateful i only spoke to show you that you need have no remorse even if you were willing to save your brother of your own accord as i suggest to you you would be simply submitting to circumstances to violence in fact if we must use that word think about it your brother s and your mother s fate are in your hands i will be your slave all my life i will wait here svidrigailov sat down on the sofa about eight steps from dounia she had not the slightest doubt now of his unbending determination besides she knew him suddenly she pulled out of her pocket a revolver cocked it and laid it in her hand on the table svidrigailov jumped up aha so that s it is it he cried surprised but smiling maliciously well that completely alters the aspect of affairs you ve made things wonderfully easier for me avdotya romanovna but where did you get the revolver was it mr razumihin why it s my revolver an old friend and how i ve hunted for it the shooting lessons i ve given you in the country have not been thrown away it s not your revolver it belonged to marfa petrovna whom you killed wretch there was nothing of yours in her house i took it when i began to suspect what you were capable of if you dare to advance one step i swear i ll kill you she was frantic but your brother i ask from curiosity said svidrigailov still standing where he was inform if you want to don t stir don t come nearer i ll shoot you poisoned your wife i know you are a murderer yourself she held the revolver ready are you so positive i poisoned marfa petrovna you did you hinted it yourself you talked to me of poison i know you went to get it you had it in readiness it was your doing it must have been your doing scoundrel even if that were true it would have been for your sake you would have been the cause you are lying i hated you always always oho avdotya romanovna you seem to have forgotten how you softened to me in the heat of propaganda i saw it in your eyes do you remember that moonlight night when the nightingale was singing that s a lie there was a flash of fury in dounia s eyes that s a lie and a libel a lie well if you like it s a lie i made it up women ought not to be reminded of such things he smiled i know you will shoot you pretty wild creature well shoot away dounia raised the revolver and deadly pale gazed at him measuring the distance and awaiting the first movement on his part her lower lip was white and quivering and her big black eyes flashed like fire he had never seen her so handsome the fire glowing in her eyes at the moment she raised the revolver seemed to kindle him and there was a pang of anguish in his heart he took a step forward and a shot rang out the bullet grazed his hair and flew into the wall behind he stood still and laughed softly the wasp has stung me she aimed straight at my head what s this blood he pulled out his handkerchief to wipe the blood which flowed in a thin stream down his right temple the bullet seemed to have just grazed the skin dounia lowered the revolver and looked at svidrigailov not so much in terror as in a sort of wild amazement she seemed not to understand what she was doing and what was going on well you missed fire again i ll wait said svidrigailov softly still smiling but gloomily if you go on like that i shall have time to seize you before you cock again dounia started quickly cocked the pistol and again raised it let me be she cried in despair i swear i ll shoot again i i ll kill you well at three paces you can hardly help it but if you don t then his eyes flashed and he took two steps forward dounia shot again it missed fire you haven t loaded it properly never mind you have another charge there get it ready i ll wait he stood facing her two paces away waiting and gazing at her with wild determination with feverishly passionate stubborn set eyes dounia saw that he would sooner die than let her go and now of course she would kill him at two paces suddenly she flung away the revolver she s dropped it said svidrigailov with surprise and he drew a deep breath a weight seemed to have rolled from his heart perhaps not only the fear of death indeed he may scarcely have felt it at that moment it was the deliverance from another feeling darker and more bitter which he could not himself have defined he went to dounia and gently put his arm round her waist she did not resist but trembling like a leaf looked at him with suppliant eyes he tried to say something but his lips moved without being able to utter a sound let me go dounia implored svidrigailov shuddered her voice now was quite different then you don t love me he asked softly dounia shook her head and and you can t never he whispered in despair never there followed a moment of terrible dumb struggle in the heart of svidrigailov he looked at her with an indescribable gaze suddenly he withdrew his arm turned quickly to the window and stood facing it another moment passed here s the key he took it out of the left pocket of his coat and laid it on the table behind him without turning or looking at dounia take it make haste he looked stubbornly out of the window dounia went up to the table to take the key make haste make haste repeated svidrigailov still without turning or moving but there seemed a terrible significance in the tone of that make haste dounia understood it snatched up the key flew to the door unlocked it quickly and rushed out of the room a minute later beside herself she ran out on to the canal bank in the direction of x bridge svidrigailov remained three minutes standing at the window at last he slowly turned looked about him and passed his hand over his forehead a strange smile contorted his face a pitiful sad weak smile a smile of despair the blood which was already getting dry smeared his hand he looked angrily at it then wetted a towel and washed his temple the revolver which dounia had flung away lay near the door and suddenly caught his eye he picked it up and examined it it was a little pocket three barrel revolver of old fashioned construction there were still two charges and one capsule left in it it could be fired again he thought a little put the revolver in his pocket took his hat and went out chapter vi he spent that evening till ten o clock going from one low haunt to another katia too turned up and sang another gutter song how a certain villain and tyrant began kissing katia svidrigailov treated katia and the organ grinder and some singers and the waiters and two little clerks he was particularly drawn to these clerks by the fact that they both had crooked noses one bent to the left and the other to the right they took him finally to a pleasure garden where he paid for their entrance there was one lanky three year old pine tree and three bushes in the garden besides a vauxhall which was in reality a drinking bar where tea too was served and there were a few green tables and chairs standing round it a chorus of wretched singers and a drunken but exceedingly depressed german clown from munich with a red nose entertained the public the clerks quarrelled with some other clerks and a fight seemed imminent svidrigailov was chosen to decide the dispute he listened to them for a quarter of an hour but they shouted so loud that there was no possibility of understanding them the only fact that seemed certain was that one of them had stolen something and had even succeeded in selling it on the spot to a jew but would not share the spoil with his companion finally it appeared that the stolen object was a teaspoon belonging to the vauxhall it was missed and the affair began to seem troublesome svidrigailov paid for the spoon got up and walked out of the garden it was about six o clock he had not drunk a drop of wine all this time and had ordered tea more for the sake of appearances than anything it was a dark and stifling evening threatening storm clouds came over the sky about ten o clock there was a clap of thunder and the rain came down like a waterfall the water fell not in drops but beat on the earth in streams there were flashes of lightning every minute and each flash lasted while one could count five drenched to the skin he went home locked himself in opened the bureau took out all his money and tore up two or three papers then putting the money in his pocket he was about to change his clothes but looking out of the window and listening to the thunder and the rain he gave up the idea took up his hat and went out of the room without locking the door he went straight to sonia she was at home she was not alone the four kapernaumov children were with her she was giving them tea she received svidrigailov in respectful silence looking wonderingly at his soaking clothes the children all ran away at once in indescribable terror svidrigailov sat down at the table and asked sonia to sit beside him she timidly prepared to listen i may be going to america sofya semyonovna said svidrigailov and as i am probably seeing you for the last time i have come to make some arrangements well did you see the lady to day i know what she said to you you need not tell me sonia made a movement and blushed those people have their own way of doing things as to your sisters and your brother they are really provided for and the money assigned to them i ve put into safe keeping and have received acknowledgments you had better take charge of the receipts in case anything happens here take them well now that s settled here are three per cent bonds to the value of three thousand roubles take those for yourself entirely for yourself and let that be strictly between ourselves so that no one knows of it whatever you hear you will need the money for to go on living in the old way sofya semyonovna is bad and besides there is no need for it now i am so much indebted to you and so are the children and my stepmother said sonia hurriedly and if i ve said so little please don t consider that s enough that s enough but as for the money arkady ivanovitch i am very grateful to you but i don t need it now i can always earn my own living don t think me ungrateful if you are so charitable that money it s for you for you sofya semyonovna and please don t waste words over it i haven t time for it you will want it rodion romanovitch has two alternatives a bullet in the brain or siberia sonia looked wildly at him and started don t be uneasy i know all about it from himself and i am not a gossip i won t tell anyone it was good advice when you told him to give himself up and confess it would be much better for him well if it turns out to be siberia he will go and you will follow him that s so isn t it and if so you ll need money you ll need it for him do you understand giving it to you is the same as my giving it to him besides you promised amalia ivanovna to pay what s owing i heard you how can you undertake such obligations so heedlessly sofya semyonovna it was katerina ivanovna s debt and not yours so you ought not to have taken any notice of the german woman you can t get through the world like that if you are ever questioned about me to morrow or the day after you will be asked don t say anything about my coming to see you now and don t show the money to anyone or say a word about it well now good bye he got up my greetings to rodion romanovitch by the way you d better put the money for the present in mr razumihin s keeping you know mr razumihin of course you do he s not a bad fellow take it to him to morrow or when the time comes and till then hide it carefully sonia too jumped up from her chair and looked in dismay at svidrigailov she longed to speak to ask a question but for the first moments she did not dare and did not know how to begin how can you how can you be going now in such rain why be starting for america and be stopped by rain ha ha good bye sofya semyonovna my dear live and live long you will be of use to others by the way tell mr razumihin i send my greetings to him tell him arkady ivanovitch svidrigailov sends his greetings be sure to he went out leaving sonia in a state of wondering anxiety and vague apprehension it appeared afterwards that on the same evening at twenty past eleven he made another very eccentric and unexpected visit the rain still persisted drenched to the skin he walked into the little flat where the parents of his betrothed lived in third street in vassilyevsky island he knocked some time before he was admitted and his visit at first caused great perturbation but svidrigailov could be very fascinating when he liked so that the first and indeed very intelligent surmise of the sensible parents that svidrigailov had probably had so much to drink that he did not know what he was doing vanished immediately the decrepit father was wheeled in to see svidrigailov by the tender and sensible mother who as usual began the conversation with various irrelevant questions she never asked a direct question but began by smiling and rubbing her hands and then if she were obliged to ascertain something for instance when svidrigailov would like to have the wedding she would begin by interested and almost eager questions about paris and the court life there and only by degrees brought the conversation round to third street on other occasions this had of course been very impressive but this time arkady ivanovitch seemed particularly impatient and insisted on seeing his betrothed at once though he had been informed to begin with that she had already gone to bed the girl of course appeared svidrigailov informed her at once that he was obliged by very important affairs to leave petersburg for a time and therefore brought her fifteen thousand roubles and begged her accept them as a present from him as he had long been intending to make her this trifling present before their wedding the logical connection of the present with his immediate departure and the absolute necessity of visiting them for that purpose in pouring rain at midnight was not made clear but it all went off very well even the inevitable ejaculations of wonder and regret the inevitable questions were extraordinarily few and restrained on the other hand the gratitude expressed was most glowing and was reinforced by tears from the most sensible of mothers svidrigailov got up laughed kissed his betrothed patted her cheek declared he would soon come back and noticing in her eyes together with childish curiosity a sort of earnest dumb inquiry reflected and kissed her again though he felt sincere anger inwardly at the thought that his present would be immediately locked up in the keeping of the most sensible of mothers he went away leaving them all in a state of extraordinary excitement but the tender mamma speaking quietly in a half whisper settled some of the most important of their doubts concluding that svidrigailov was a great man a man of great affairs and connections and of great wealth there was no knowing what he had in his mind he would start off on a journey and give away money just as the fancy took him so that there was nothing surprising about it of course it was strange that he was wet through but englishmen for instance are even more eccentric and all these people of high society didn t think of what was said of them and didn t stand on ceremony possibly indeed he came like that on purpose to show that he was not afraid of anyone above all not a word should be said about it for god knows what might come of it and the money must be locked up and it was most fortunate that fedosya the cook had not left the kitchen and above all not a word must be said to that old cat madame resslich and so on and so on they sat up whispering till two o clock but the girl went to bed much earlier amazed and rather sorrowful svidrigailov meanwhile exactly at midnight crossed the bridge on the way back to the mainland the rain had ceased and there was a roaring wind he began shivering and for one moment he gazed at the black waters of the little neva with a look of special interest even inquiry but he soon felt it very cold standing by the water he turned and went towards y prospect he walked along that endless street for a long time almost half an hour more than once stumbling in the dark on the wooden pavement but continually looking for something on the right side of the street he had noticed passing through this street lately that there was a hotel somewhere towards the end built of wood but fairly large and its name he remembered was something like adrianople he was not mistaken the hotel was so conspicuous in that god forsaken place that he could not fail to see it even in the dark it was a long blackened wooden building and in spite of the late hour there were lights in the windows and signs of life within he went in and asked a ragged fellow who met him in the corridor for a room the latter scanning svidrigailov pulled himself together and led him at once to a close and tiny room in the distance at the end of the corridor under the stairs there was no other all were occupied the ragged fellow looked inquiringly is there tea asked svidrigailov yes sir what else is there veal vodka savouries bring me tea and veal and you want nothing else he asked with apparent surprise nothing nothing the ragged man went away completely disillusioned it must be a nice place thought svidrigailov how was it i didn t know it i expect i look as if i came from a cafe chantant and have had some adventure on the way it would be interesting to know who stay here he lighted the candle and looked at the room more carefully it was a room so low pitched that svidrigailov could only just stand up in it it had one window the bed which was very dirty and the plain stained chair and table almost filled it up the walls looked as though they were made of planks covered with shabby paper so torn and dusty that the pattern was indistinguishable though the general colour yellow could still be made out one of the walls was cut short by the sloping ceiling though the room was not an attic but just under the stairs svidrigailov set down the candle sat down on the bed and sank into thought but a strange persistent murmur which sometimes rose to a shout in the next room attracted his attention the murmur had not ceased from the moment he entered the room he listened someone was upbraiding and almost tearfully scolding but he heard only one voice svidrigailov got up shaded the light with his hand and at once he saw light through a crack in the wall he went up and peeped through the room which was somewhat larger than his had two occupants one of them a very curly headed man with a red inflamed face was standing in the pose of an orator without his coat with his legs wide apart to preserve his balance and smiting himself on the breast he reproached the other with being a beggar with having no standing whatever he declared that he had taken the other out of the gutter and he could turn him out when he liked and that only the finger of providence sees it all the object of his reproaches was sitting in a chair and had the air of a man who wants dreadfully to sneeze but can t he sometimes turned sheepish and befogged eyes on the speaker but obviously had not the slightest idea what he was talking about and scarcely heard it a candle was burning down on the table there were wine glasses a nearly empty bottle of vodka bread and cucumber and glasses with the dregs of stale tea after gazing attentively at this svidrigailov turned away indifferently and sat down on the bed the ragged attendant returning with the tea could not resist asking him again whether he didn t want anything more and again receiving a negative reply finally withdrew svidrigailov made haste to drink a glass of tea to warm himself but could not eat anything he began to feel feverish he took off his coat and wrapping himself in the blanket lay down on the bed he was annoyed it would have been better to be well for the occasion he thought with a smile the room was close the candle burnt dimly the wind was roaring outside he heard a mouse scratching in the corner and the room smelt of mice and of leather he lay in a sort of reverie one thought followed another he felt a longing to fix his imagination on something it must be a garden under the window he thought there s a sound of trees how i dislike the sound of trees on a stormy night in the dark they give one a horrid feeling he remembered how he had disliked it when he passed petrovsky park just now this reminded him of the bridge over the little neva and he felt cold again as he had when standing there i never have liked water he thought even in a landscape and he suddenly smiled again at a strange idea surely now all these questions of taste and comfort ought not to matter but i ve become more particular like an animal that picks out a special place for such an occasion i ought to have gone into the petrovsky park i suppose it seemed dark cold ha ha as though i were seeking pleasant sensations by the way why haven t i put out the candle he blew it out they ve gone to bed next door he thought not seeing the light at the crack well now marfa petrovna now is the time for you to turn up it s dark and the very time and place for you but now you won t come he suddenly recalled how an hour before carrying out his design on dounia he had recommended raskolnikov to trust her to razumihin s keeping i suppose i really did say it as raskolnikov guessed to tease myself but what a rogue that raskolnikov is he s gone through a good deal he may be a successful rogue in time when he s got over his nonsense but now he s too eager for life these young men are contemptible on that point but hang the fellow let him please himself it s nothing to do with me he could not get to sleep by degrees dounia s image rose before him and a shudder ran over him no i must give up all that now he thought rousing himself i must think of something else it s queer and funny i never had a great hatred for anyone i never particularly desired to avenge myself even and that s a bad sign a bad sign a bad sign i never liked quarrelling either and never lost my temper that s a bad sign too and the promises i made her just now too damnation but who knows perhaps she would have made a new man of me somehow he ground his teeth and sank into silence again again dounia s image rose before him just as she was when after shooting the first time she had lowered the revolver in terror and gazed blankly at him so that he might have seized her twice over and she would not have lifted a hand to defend herself if he had not reminded her he recalled how at that instant he felt almost sorry for her how he had felt a pang at his heart aie damnation these thoughts again i must put it away he was dozing off the feverish shiver had ceased when suddenly something seemed to run over his arm and leg under the bedclothes he started ugh hang it i believe it s a mouse he thought that s the veal i left on the table he felt fearfully disinclined to pull off the blanket get up get cold but all at once something unpleasant ran over his leg again he pulled off the blanket and lighted the candle shaking with feverish chill he bent down to examine the bed there was nothing he shook the blanket and suddenly a mouse jumped out on the sheet he tried to catch it but the mouse ran to and fro in zigzags without leaving the bed slipped between his fingers ran over his hand and suddenly darted under the pillow he threw down the pillow but in one instant felt something leap on his chest and dart over his body and down his back under his shirt he trembled nervously and woke up the room was dark he was lying on the bed and wrapped up in the blanket as before the wind was howling under the window how disgusting he thought with annoyance he got up and sat on the edge of the bedstead with his back to the window it s better not to sleep at all he decided there was a cold damp draught from the window however without getting up he drew the blanket over him and wrapped himself in it he was not thinking of anything and did not want to think but one image rose after another incoherent scraps of thought without beginning or end passed through his mind he sank into drowsiness perhaps the cold or the dampness or the dark or the wind that howled under the window and tossed the trees roused a sort of persistent craving for the fantastic he kept dwelling on images of flowers he fancied a charming flower garden a bright warm almost hot day a holiday trinity day a fine sumptuous country cottage in the english taste overgrown with fragrant flowers with flower beds going round the house the porch wreathed in climbers was surrounded with beds of roses a light cool staircase carpeted with rich rugs was decorated with rare plants in china pots he noticed particularly in the windows nosegays of tender white heavily fragrant narcissus bending over their bright green thick long stalks he was reluctant to move away from them but he went up the stairs and came into a large high drawing room and again everywhere at the windows the doors on to the balcony and on the balcony itself were flowers the floors were strewn with freshly cut fragrant hay the windows were open a fresh cool light air came into the room the birds were chirruping under the window and in the middle of the room on a table covered with a white satin shroud stood a coffin the coffin was covered with white silk and edged with a thick white frill wreaths of flowers surrounded it on all sides among the flowers lay a girl in a white muslin dress with her arms crossed and pressed on her bosom as though carved out of marble but her loose fair hair was wet there was a wreath of roses on her head the stern and already rigid profile of her face looked as though chiselled of marble too and the smile on her pale lips was full of an immense unchildish misery and sorrowful appeal svidrigailov knew that girl there was no holy image no burning candle beside the coffin no sound of prayers the girl had drowned herself she was only fourteen but her heart was broken and she had destroyed herself crushed by an insult that had appalled and amazed that childish soul had smirched that angel purity with unmerited disgrace and torn from her a last scream of despair unheeded and brutally disregarded on a dark night in the cold and wet while the wind howled svidrigailov came to himself got up from the bed and went to the window he felt for the latch and opened it the wind lashed furiously into the little room and stung his face and his chest only covered with his shirt as though with frost under the window there must have been something like a garden and apparently a pleasure garden there too probably there were tea tables and singing in the daytime now drops of rain flew in at the window from the trees and bushes it was dark as in a cellar so that he could only just make out some dark blurs of objects svidrigailov bending down with elbows on the window sill gazed for five minutes into the darkness the boom of a cannon followed by a second one resounded in the darkness of the night ah the signal the river is overflowing he thought by morning it will be swirling down the street in the lower parts flooding the basements and cellars the cellar rats will swim out and men will curse in the rain and wind as they drag their rubbish to their upper storeys what time is it now and he had hardly thought it when somewhere near a clock on the wall ticking away hurriedly struck three aha it will be light in an hour why wait i ll go out at once straight to the park i ll choose a great bush there drenched with rain so that as soon as one s shoulder touches it millions of drops drip on one s head he moved away from the window shut it lighted the candle put on his waistcoat his overcoat and his hat and went out carrying the candle into the passage to look for the ragged attendant who would be asleep somewhere in the midst of candle ends and all sorts of rubbish to pay him for the room and leave the hotel it s the best minute i couldn t choose a better he walked for some time through a long narrow corridor without finding anyone and was just going to call out when suddenly in a dark corner between an old cupboard and the door he caught sight of a strange object which seemed to be alive he bent down with the candle and saw a little girl not more than five years old shivering and crying with her clothes as wet as a soaking house flannel she did not seem afraid of svidrigailov but looked at him with blank amazement out of her big black eyes now and then she sobbed as children do when they have been crying a long time but are beginning to be comforted the child s face was pale and tired she was numb with cold how can she have come here she must have hidden here and not slept all night he began questioning her the child suddenly becoming animated chattered away in her baby language something about mammy and that mammy would beat her and about some cup that she had bwoken the child chattered on without stopping he could only guess from what she said that she was a neglected child whose mother probably a drunken cook in the service of the hotel whipped and frightened her that the child had broken a cup of her mother s and was so frightened that she had run away the evening before had hidden for a long while somewhere outside in the rain at last had made her way in here hidden behind the cupboard and spent the night there crying and trembling from the damp the darkness and the fear that she would be badly beaten for it he took her in his arms went back to his room sat her on the bed and began undressing her the torn shoes which she had on her stockingless feet were as wet as if they had been standing in a puddle all night when he had undressed her he put her on the bed covered her up and wrapped her in the blanket from her head downwards she fell asleep at once then he sank into dreary musing again what folly to trouble myself he decided suddenly with an oppressive feeling of annoyance what idiocy in vexation he took up the candle to go and look for the ragged attendant again and make haste to go away damn the child he thought as he opened the door but he turned again to see whether the child was asleep he raised the blanket carefully the child was sleeping soundly she had got warm under the blanket and her pale cheeks were flushed but strange to say that flush seemed brighter and coarser than the rosy cheeks of childhood it s a flush of fever thought svidrigailov it was like the flush from drinking as though she had been given a full glass to drink her crimson lips were hot and glowing but what was this he suddenly fancied that her long black eyelashes were quivering as though the lids were opening and a sly crafty eye peeped out with an unchildlike wink as though the little girl were not asleep but pretending yes it was so her lips parted in a smile the corners of her mouth quivered as though she were trying to control them but now she quite gave up all effort now it was a grin a broad grin there was something shameless provocative in that quite unchildish face it was depravity it was the face of a harlot the shameless face of a french harlot now both eyes opened wide they turned a glowing shameless glance upon him they laughed invited him there was something infinitely hideous and shocking in that laugh in those eyes in such nastiness in the face of a child what at five years old svidrigailov muttered in genuine horror what does it mean and now she turned to him her little face all aglow holding out her arms accursed child svidrigailov cried raising his hand to strike her but at that moment he woke up he was in the same bed still wrapped in the blanket the candle had not been lighted and daylight was streaming in at the windows i ve had nightmare all night he got up angrily feeling utterly shattered his bones ached there was a thick mist outside and he could see nothing it was nearly five he had overslept himself he got up put on his still damp jacket and overcoat feeling the revolver in his pocket he took it out and then he sat down took a notebook out of his pocket and in the most conspicuous place on the title page wrote a few lines in large letters reading them over he sank into thought with his elbows on the table the revolver and the notebook lay beside him some flies woke up and settled on the untouched veal which was still on the table he stared at them and at last with his free right hand began trying to catch one he tried till he was tired but could not catch it at last realising that he was engaged in this interesting pursuit he started got up and walked resolutely out of the room a minute later he was in the street a thick milky mist hung over the town svidrigailov walked along the slippery dirty wooden pavement towards the little neva he was picturing the waters of the little neva swollen in the night petrovsky island the wet paths the wet grass the wet trees and bushes and at last the bush he began ill humouredly staring at the houses trying to think of something else there was not a cabman or a passer by in the street the bright yellow wooden little houses looked dirty and dejected with their closed shutters the cold and damp penetrated his whole body and he began to shiver from time to time he came across shop signs and read each carefully at last he reached the end of the wooden pavement and came to a big stone house a dirty shivering dog crossed his path with its tail between its legs a man in a greatcoat lay face downwards dead drunk across the pavement he looked at him and went on a high tower stood up on the left bah he shouted here is a place why should it be petrovsky it will be in the presence of an official witness anyway he almost smiled at this new thought and turned into the street where there was the big house with the tower at the great closed gates of the house a little man stood with his shoulder leaning against them wrapped in a grey soldier s coat with a copper achilles helmet on his head he cast a drowsy and indifferent glance at svidrigailov his face wore that perpetual look of peevish dejection which is so sourly printed on all faces of jewish race without exception they both svidrigailov and achilles stared at each other for a few minutes without speaking at last it struck achilles as irregular for a man not drunk to be standing three steps from him staring and not saying a word what do you want here he said without moving or changing his position nothing brother good morning answered svidrigailov this isn t the place i am going to foreign parts brother to foreign parts to america america svidrigailov took out the revolver and cocked it achilles raised his eyebrows i say this is not the place for such jokes why shouldn t it be the place because it isn t well brother i don t mind that it s a good place when you are asked you just say he was going he said to america he put the revolver to his right temple you can t do it here it s not the place cried achilles rousing himself his eyes growing bigger and bigger svidrigailov pulled the trigger chapter vii the same day about seven o clock in the evening raskolnikov was on his way to his mother s and sister s lodging the lodging in bakaleyev s house which razumihin had found for them the stairs went up from the street raskolnikov walked with lagging steps as though still hesitating whether to go or not but nothing would have turned him back his decision was taken besides it doesn t matter they still know nothing he thought and they are used to thinking of me as eccentric he was appallingly dressed his clothes torn and dirty soaked with a night s rain his face was almost distorted from fatigue exposure the inward conflict that had lasted for twenty four hours he had spent all the previous night alone god knows where but anyway he had reached a decision he knocked at the door which was opened by his mother dounia was not at home even the servant happened to be out at first pulcheria alexandrovna was speechless with joy and surprise then she took him by the hand and drew him into the room here you are she began faltering with joy don t be angry with me rodya for welcoming you so foolishly with tears i am laughing not crying did you think i was crying no i am delighted but i ve got into such a stupid habit of shedding tears i ve been like that ever since your father s death i cry for anything sit down dear boy you must be tired i see you are ah how muddy you are i was in the rain yesterday mother raskolnikov began no no pulcheria alexandrovna hurriedly interrupted you thought i was going to cross question you in the womanish way i used to don t be anxious i understand i understand it all now i ve learned the ways here and truly i see for myself that they are better i ve made up my mind once for all how could i understand your plans and expect you to give an account of them god knows what concerns and plans you may have or what ideas you are hatching so it s not for me to keep nudging your elbow asking you what you are thinking about but my goodness why am i running to and fro as though i were crazy i am reading your article in the magazine for the third time rodya dmitri prokofitch brought it to me directly i saw it i cried out to myself there foolish one i thought that s what he is busy about that s the solution of the mystery learned people are always like that he may have some new ideas in his head just now he is thinking them over and i worry him and upset him i read it my dear and of course there was a great deal i did not understand but that s only natural how should i show me mother raskolnikov took the magazine and glanced at his article incongruous as it was with his mood and his circumstances he felt that strange and bitter sweet sensation that every author experiences the first time he sees himself in print besides he was only twenty three it lasted only a moment after reading a few lines he frowned and his heart throbbed with anguish he recalled all the inward conflict of the preceding months he flung the article on the table with disgust and anger but however foolish i may be rodya i can see for myself that you will very soon be one of the leading if not the leading man in the world of russian thought and they dared to think you were mad you don t know but they really thought that ah the despicable creatures how could they understand genius and dounia dounia was all but believing it what do you say to that your father sent twice to magazines the first time poems i ve got the manuscript and will show you and the second time a whole novel i begged him to let me copy it out and how we prayed that they should be taken they weren t i was breaking my heart rodya six or seven days ago over your food and your clothes and the way you are living but now i see again how foolish i was for you can attain any position you like by your intellect and talent no doubt you don t care about that for the present and you are occupied with much more important matters dounia s not at home mother no rodya i often don t see her she leaves me alone dmitri prokofitch comes to see me it s so good of him and he always talks about you he loves you and respects you my dear i don t say that dounia is very wanting in consideration i am not complaining she has her ways and i have mine she seems to have got some secrets of late and i never have any secrets from you two of course i am sure that dounia has far too much sense and besides she loves you and me but i don t know what it will all lead to you ve made me so happy by coming now rodya but she has missed you by going out when she comes in i ll tell her your brother came in while you were out where have you been all this time you mustn t spoil me rodya you know come when you can but if you can t it doesn t matter i can wait i shall know anyway that you are fond of me that will be enough for me i shall read what you write i shall hear about you from everyone and sometimes you ll come yourself to see me what could be better here you ve come now to comfort your mother i see that here pulcheria alexandrovna began to cry here i am again don t mind my foolishness my goodness why am i sitting here she cried jumping up there is coffee and i don t offer you any ah that s the selfishness of old age i ll get it at once mother don t trouble i am going at once i haven t come for that please listen to me pulcheria alexandrovna went up to him timidly mother whatever happens whatever you hear about me whatever you are told about me will you always love me as you do now he asked suddenly from the fullness of his heart as though not thinking of his words and not weighing them rodya rodya what is the matter how can you ask me such a question why who will tell me anything about you besides i shouldn t believe anyone i should refuse to listen i ve come to assure you that i ve always loved you and i am glad that we are alone even glad dounia is out he went on with the same impulse i have come to tell you that though you will be unhappy you must believe that your son loves you now more than himself and that all you thought about me that i was cruel and didn t care about you was all a mistake i shall never cease to love you well that s enough i thought i must do this and begin with this pulcheria alexandrovna embraced him in silence pressing him to her bosom and weeping gently i don t know what is wrong with you rodya she said at last i ve been thinking all this time that we were simply boring you and now i see that there is a great sorrow in store for you and that s why you are miserable i ve foreseen it a long time rodya forgive me for speaking about it i keep thinking about it and lie awake at nights your sister lay talking in her sleep all last night talking of nothing but you i caught something but i couldn t make it out i felt all the morning as though i were going to be hanged waiting for something expecting something and now it has come rodya rodya where are you going you are going away somewhere yes that s what i thought i can come with you you know if you need me and dounia too she loves you she loves you dearly and sofya semyonovna may come with us if you like you see i am glad to look upon her as a daughter even dmitri prokofitch will help us to go together but where are you going good bye mother what to day she cried as though losing him for ever i can t stay i must go now and can t i come with you no but kneel down and pray to god for me your prayer perhaps will reach him let me bless you and sign you with the cross that s right that s right oh god what are we doing yes he was glad he was very glad that there was no one there that he was alone with his mother for the first time after all those awful months his heart was softened he fell down before her he kissed her feet and both wept embracing and she was not surprised and did not question him this time for some days she had realised that something awful was happening to her son and that now some terrible minute had come for him rodya my darling my first born she said sobbing now you are just as when you were little you would run like this to me and hug me and kiss me when your father was living and we were poor you comforted us simply by being with us and when i buried your father how often we wept together at his grave and embraced as now and if i ve been crying lately it s that my mother s heart had a foreboding of trouble the first time i saw you that evening you remember as soon as we arrived here i guessed simply from your eyes my heart sank at once and to day when i opened the door and looked at you i thought the fatal hour had come rodya rodya you are not going away to day no you ll come again yes i ll come rodya don t be angry i don t dare to question you i know i mustn t only say two words to me is it far where you are going very far what is awaiting you there some post or career for you what god sends only pray for me raskolnikov went to the door but she clutched him and gazed despairingly into his eyes her face worked with terror enough mother said raskolnikov deeply regretting that he had come not for ever it s not yet for ever you ll come you ll come to morrow i will i will good bye he tore himself away at last it was a warm fresh bright evening it had cleared up in the morning raskolnikov went to his lodgings he made haste he wanted to finish all before sunset he did not want to meet anyone till then going up the stairs he noticed that nastasya rushed from the samovar to watch him intently can anyone have come to see me he wondered he had a disgusted vision of porfiry but opening his door he saw dounia she was sitting alone plunged in deep thought and looked as though she had been waiting a long time he stopped short in the doorway she rose from the sofa in dismay and stood up facing him her eyes fixed upon him betrayed horror and infinite grief and from those eyes alone he saw at once that she knew am i to come in or go away he asked uncertainly i ve been all day with sofya semyonovna we were both waiting for you we thought that you would be sure to come there raskolnikov went into the room and sank exhausted on a chair i feel weak dounia i am very tired and i should have liked at this moment to be able to control myself he glanced at her mistrustfully where were you all night i don t remember clearly you see sister i wanted to make up my mind once for all and several times i walked by the neva i remember that i wanted to end it all there but i couldn t make up my mind he whispered looking at her mistrustfully again thank god that was just what we were afraid of sofya semyonovna and i then you still have faith in life thank god thank god raskolnikov smiled bitterly i haven t faith but i have just been weeping in mother s arms i haven t faith but i have just asked her to pray for me i don t know how it is dounia i don t understand it have you been at mother s have you told her cried dounia horror stricken surely you haven t done that no i didn t tell her in words but she understood a great deal she heard you talking in your sleep i am sure she half understands it already perhaps i did wrong in going to see her i don t know why i did go i am a contemptible person dounia a contemptible person but ready to face suffering you are aren t you yes i am going at once yes to escape the disgrace i thought of drowning myself dounia but as i looked into the water i thought that if i had considered myself strong till now i d better not be afraid of disgrace he said hurrying on it s pride dounia pride rodya there was a gleam of fire in his lustreless eyes he seemed to be glad to think that he was still proud you don t think sister that i was simply afraid of the water he asked looking into her face with a sinister smile oh rodya hush cried dounia bitterly silence lasted for two minutes he sat with his eyes fixed on the floor dounia stood at the other end of the table and looked at him with anguish suddenly he got up it s late it s time to go i am going at once to give myself up but i don t know why i am going to give myself up big tears fell down her cheeks you are crying sister but can you hold out your hand to me you doubted it she threw her arms round him aren t you half expiating your crime by facing the suffering she cried holding him close and kissing him crime what crime he cried in sudden fury that i killed a vile noxious insect an old pawnbroker woman of use to no one killing her was atonement for forty sins she was sucking the life out of poor people was that a crime i am not thinking of it and i am not thinking of expiating it and why are you all rubbing it in on all sides a crime a crime only now i see clearly the imbecility of my cowardice now that i have decided to face this superfluous disgrace it s simply because i am contemptible and have nothing in me that i have decided to perhaps too for my advantage as that porfiry suggested brother brother what are you saying why you have shed blood cried dounia in despair which all men shed he put in almost frantically which flows and has always flowed in streams which is spilt like champagne and for which men are crowned in the capitol and are called afterwards benefactors of mankind look into it more carefully and understand it i too wanted to do good to men and would have done hundreds thousands of good deeds to make up for that one piece of stupidity not stupidity even simply clumsiness for the idea was by no means so stupid as it seems now that it has failed everything seems stupid when it fails by that stupidity i only wanted to put myself into an independent position to take the first step to obtain means and then everything would have been smoothed over by benefits immeasurable in comparison but i i couldn t carry out even the first step because i am contemptible that s what s the matter and yet i won t look at it as you do if i had succeeded i should have been crowned with glory but now i m trapped but that s not so not so brother what are you saying ah it s not picturesque not aesthetically attractive i fail to understand why bombarding people by regular siege is more honourable the fear of appearances is the first symptom of impotence i ve never never recognised this more clearly than now and i am further than ever from seeing that what i did was a crime i ve never never been stronger and more convinced than now the colour had rushed into his pale exhausted face but as he uttered his last explanation he happened to meet dounia s eyes and he saw such anguish in them that he could not help being checked he felt that he had anyway made these two poor women miserable that he was anyway the cause dounia darling if i am guilty forgive me though i cannot be forgiven if i am guilty good bye we won t dispute it s time high time to go don t follow me i beseech you i have somewhere else to go but you go at once and sit with mother i entreat you to it s my last request of you don t leave her at all i left her in a state of anxiety that she is not fit to bear she will die or go out of her mind be with her razumihin will be with you i ve been talking to him don t cry about me i ll try to be honest and manly all my life even if i am a murderer perhaps i shall some day make a name i won t disgrace you you will see i ll still show now good bye for the present he concluded hurriedly noticing again a strange expression in dounia s eyes at his last words and promises why are you crying don t cry don t cry we are not parting for ever ah yes wait a minute i d forgotten he went to the table took up a thick dusty book opened it and took from between the pages a little water colour portrait on ivory it was the portrait of his landlady s daughter who had died of fever that strange girl who had wanted to be a nun for a minute he gazed at the delicate expressive face of his betrothed kissed the portrait and gave it to dounia i used to talk a great deal about it to her only to her he said thoughtfully to her heart i confided much of what has since been so hideously realised don t be uneasy he returned to dounia she was as much opposed to it as you and i am glad that she is gone the great point is that everything now is going to be different is going to be broken in two he cried suddenly returning to his dejection everything everything and am i prepared for it do i want it myself they say it is necessary for me to suffer what s the object of these senseless sufferings shall i know any better what they are for when i am crushed by hardships and idiocy and weak as an old man after twenty years penal servitude and what shall i have to live for then why am i consenting to that life now oh i knew i was contemptible when i stood looking at the neva at daybreak to day at last they both went out it was hard for dounia but she loved him she walked away but after going fifty paces she turned round to look at him again he was still in sight at the corner he too turned and for the last time their eyes met but noticing that she was looking at him he motioned her away with impatience and even vexation and turned the corner abruptly i am wicked i see that he thought to himself feeling ashamed a moment later of his angry gesture to dounia but why are they so fond of me if i don t deserve it oh if only i were alone and no one loved me and i too had never loved anyone nothing of all this would have happened but i wonder shall i in those fifteen or twenty years grow so meek that i shall humble myself before people and whimper at every word that i am a criminal yes that s it that s it that s what they are sending me there for that s what they want look at them running to and fro about the streets every one of them a scoundrel and a criminal at heart and worse still an idiot but try to get me off and they d be wild with righteous indignation oh how i hate them all he fell to musing by what process it could come to pass that he could be humbled before all of them indiscriminately humbled by conviction and yet why not it must be so would not twenty years of continual bondage crush him utterly water wears out a stone and why why should he live after that why should he go now when he knew that it would be so it was the hundredth time perhaps that he had asked himself that question since the previous evening but still he went chapter viii when he went into sonia s room it was already getting dark all day sonia had been waiting for him in terrible anxiety dounia had been waiting with her she had come to her that morning remembering svidrigailov s words that sonia knew we will not describe the conversation and tears of the two girls and how friendly they became dounia gained one comfort at least from that interview that her brother would not be alone he had gone to her sonia first with his confession he had gone to her for human fellowship when he needed it she would go with him wherever fate might send him dounia did not ask but she knew it was so she looked at sonia almost with reverence and at first almost embarrassed her by it sonia was almost on the point of tears she felt herself on the contrary hardly worthy to look at dounia dounia s gracious image when she had bowed to her so attentively and respectfully at their first meeting in raskolnikov s room had remained in her mind as one of the fairest visions of her life dounia at last became impatient and leaving sonia went to her brother s room to await him there she kept thinking that he would come there first when she had gone sonia began to be tortured by the dread of his committing suicide and dounia too feared it but they had spent the day trying to persuade each other that that could not be and both were less anxious while they were together as soon as they parted each thought of nothing else sonia remembered how svidrigailov had said to her the day before that raskolnikov had two alternatives siberia or besides she knew his vanity his pride and his lack of faith is it possible that he has nothing but cowardice and fear of death to make him live she thought at last in despair meanwhile the sun was setting sonia was standing in dejection looking intently out of the window but from it she could see nothing but the unwhitewashed blank wall of the next house at last when she began to feel sure of his death he walked into the room she gave a cry of joy but looking carefully into his face she turned pale yes said raskolnikov smiling i have come for your cross sonia it was you told me to go to the cross roads why is it you are frightened now it s come to that sonia gazed at him astonished his tone seemed strange to her a cold shiver ran over her but in a moment she guessed that the tone and the words were a mask he spoke to her looking away as though to avoid meeting her eyes you see sonia i ve decided that it will be better so there is one fact but it s a long story and there s no need to discuss it but do you know what angers me it annoys me that all those stupid brutish faces will be gaping at me directly pestering me with their stupid questions which i shall have to answer they ll point their fingers at me tfoo you know i am not going to porfiry i am sick of him i d rather go to my friend the explosive lieutenant how i shall surprise him what a sensation i shall make but i must be cooler i ve become too irritable of late you know i was nearly shaking my fist at my sister just now because she turned to take a last look at me it s a brutal state to be in ah what am i coming to well where are the crosses he seemed hardly to know what he was doing he could not stay still or concentrate his attention on anything his ideas seemed to gallop after one another he talked incoherently his hands trembled slightly without a word sonia took out of the drawer two crosses one of cypress wood and one of copper she made the sign of the cross over herself and over him and put the wooden cross on his neck it s the symbol of my taking up the cross he laughed as though i had not suffered much till now the wooden cross that is the peasant one the copper one that is lizaveta s you will wear yourself show me so she had it on at that moment i remember two things like these too a silver one and a little ikon i threw them back on the old woman s neck those would be appropriate now really those are what i ought to put on now but i am talking nonsense and forgetting what matters i m somehow forgetful you see i have come to warn you sonia so that you might know that s all that s all i came for but i thought i had more to say you wanted me to go yourself well now i am going to prison and you ll have your wish well what are you crying for you too don t leave off oh how i hate it all but his feeling was stirred his heart ached as he looked at her why is she grieving too he thought to himself what am i to her why does she weep why is she looking after me like my mother or dounia she ll be my nurse cross yourself say at least one prayer sonia begged in a timid broken voice oh certainly as much as you like and sincerely sonia sincerely but he wanted to say something quite different he crossed himself several times sonia took up her shawl and put it over her head it was the green drap de dames shawl of which marmeladov had spoken the family shawl raskolnikov thought of that looking at it but he did not ask he began to feel himself that he was certainly forgetting things and was disgustingly agitated he was frightened at this he was suddenly struck too by the thought that sonia meant to go with him what are you doing where are you going stay here stay i ll go alone he cried in cowardly vexation and almost resentful he moved towards the door what s the use of going in procession he muttered going out sonia remained standing in the middle of the room he had not even said good bye to her he had forgotten her a poignant and rebellious doubt surged in his heart was it right was it right all this he thought again as he went down the stairs couldn t he stop and retract it all and not go but still he went he felt suddenly once for all that he mustn t ask himself questions as he turned into the street he remembered that he had not said good bye to sonia that he had left her in the middle of the room in her green shawl not daring to stir after he had shouted at her and he stopped short for a moment at the same instant another thought dawned upon him as though it had been lying in wait to strike him then why with what object did i go to her just now i told her on business on what business i had no sort of business to tell her i was going but where was the need do i love her no no i drove her away just now like a dog did i want her crosses oh how low i ve sunk no i wanted her tears i wanted to see her terror to see how her heart ached i had to have something to cling to something to delay me some friendly face to see and i dared to believe in myself to dream of what i would do i am a beggarly contemptible wretch contemptible he walked along the canal bank and he had not much further to go but on reaching the bridge he stopped and turning out of his way along it went to the hay market he looked eagerly to right and left gazed intently at every object and could not fix his attention on anything everything slipped away in another week another month i shall be driven in a prison van over this bridge how shall i look at the canal then i should like to remember this slipped into his mind look at this sign how shall i read those letters then it s written here campany that s a thing to remember that letter a and to look at it again in a month how shall i look at it then what shall i be feeling and thinking then how trivial it all must be what i am fretting about now of course it must all be interesting in its way ha ha ha what am i thinking about i am becoming a baby i am showing off to myself why am i ashamed foo how people shove that fat man a german he must be who pushed against me does he know whom he pushed there s a peasant woman with a baby begging it s curious that she thinks me happier than she is i might give her something for the incongruity of it here s a five copeck piece left in my pocket where did i get it here here take it my good woman god bless you the beggar chanted in a lachrymose voice he went into the hay market it was distasteful very distasteful to be in a crowd but he walked just where he saw most people he would have given anything in the world to be alone but he knew himself that he would not have remained alone for a moment there was a man drunk and disorderly in the crowd he kept trying to dance and falling down there was a ring round him raskolnikov squeezed his way through the crowd stared for some minutes at the drunken man and suddenly gave a short jerky laugh a minute later he had forgotten him and did not see him though he still stared he moved away at last not remembering where he was but when he got into the middle of the square an emotion suddenly came over him overwhelming him body and mind he suddenly recalled sonia s words go to the cross roads bow down to the people kiss the earth for you have sinned against it too and say aloud to the whole world i am a murderer he trembled remembering that and the hopeless misery and anxiety of all that time especially of the last hours had weighed so heavily upon him that he positively clutched at the chance of this new unmixed complete sensation it came over him like a fit it was like a single spark kindled in his soul and spreading fire through him everything in him softened at once and the tears started into his eyes he fell to the earth on the spot he knelt down in the middle of the square bowed down to the earth and kissed that filthy earth with bliss and rapture he got up and bowed down a second time he s boozed a youth near him observed there was a roar of laughter he s going to jerusalem brothers and saying good bye to his children and his country he s bowing down to all the world and kissing the great city of st petersburg and its pavement added a workman who was a little drunk quite a young man too observed a third and a gentleman someone observed soberly there s no knowing who s a gentleman and who isn t nowadays these exclamations and remarks checked raskolnikov and the words i am a murderer which were perhaps on the point of dropping from his lips died away he bore these remarks quietly however and without looking round he turned down a street leading to the police office he had a glimpse of something on the way which did not surprise him he had felt that it must be so the second time he bowed down in the hay market he saw standing fifty paces from him on the left sonia she was hiding from him behind one of the wooden shanties in the market place she had followed him then on his painful way raskolnikov at that moment felt and knew once for all that sonia was with him for ever and would follow him to the ends of the earth wherever fate might take him it wrung his heart but he was just reaching the fatal place he went into the yard fairly resolutely he had to mount to the third storey i shall be some time going up he thought he felt as though the fateful moment was still far off as though he had plenty of time left for consideration again the same rubbish the same eggshells lying about on the spiral stairs again the open doors of the flats again the same kitchens and the same fumes and stench coming from them raskolnikov had not been here since that day his legs were numb and gave way under him but still they moved forward he stopped for a moment to take breath to collect himself so as to enter like a man but why what for he wondered reflecting if i must drink the cup what difference does it make the more revolting the better he imagined for an instant the figure of the explosive lieutenant ilya petrovitch was he actually going to him couldn t he go to someone else to nikodim fomitch couldn t he turn back and go straight to nikodim fomitch s lodgings at least then it would be done privately no no to the explosive lieutenant if he must drink it drink it off at once turning cold and hardly conscious he opened the door of the office there were very few people in it this time only a house porter and a peasant the doorkeeper did not even peep out from behind his screen raskolnikov walked into the next room perhaps i still need not speak passed through his mind some sort of clerk not wearing a uniform was settling himself at a bureau to write in a corner another clerk was seating himself zametov was not there nor of course nikodim fomitch no one in raskolnikov asked addressing the person at the bureau whom do you want a ah not a sound was heard not a sight was seen but i scent the russian how does it go on in the fairy tale i ve forgotten at your service a familiar voice cried suddenly raskolnikov shuddered the explosive lieutenant stood before him he had just come in from the third room it is the hand of fate thought raskolnikov why is he here you ve come to see us what about cried ilya petrovitch he was obviously in an exceedingly good humour and perhaps a trifle exhilarated if it s on business you are rather early it s only a chance that i am here however i ll do what i can i must admit i what is it what is it excuse me dostoevsky appears to have forgotten that it is after sunset and that the last time raskolnikov visited the police office at two in the afternoon he was reproached for coming too late translator raskolnikov of course raskolnikov you didn t imagine i d forgotten don t think i am like that rodion ro ro rodionovitch that s it isn t it rodion romanovitch yes yes of course rodion romanovitch i was just getting at it i made many inquiries about you i assure you i ve been genuinely grieved since that since i behaved like that it was explained to me afterwards that you were a literary man and a learned one too and so to say the first steps mercy on us what literary or scientific man does not begin by some originality of conduct my wife and i have the greatest respect for literature in my wife it s a genuine passion literature and art if only a man is a gentleman all the rest can be gained by talents learning good sense genius as for a hat well what does a hat matter i can buy a hat as easily as i can a bun but what s under the hat what the hat covers i can t buy that i was even meaning to come and apologise to you but thought maybe you d but i am forgetting to ask you is there anything you want really i hear your family have come yes my mother and sister i ve even had the honour and happiness of meeting your sister a highly cultivated and charming person i confess i was sorry i got so hot with you there it is but as for my looking suspiciously at your fainting fit that affair has been cleared up splendidly bigotry and fanaticism i understand your indignation perhaps you are changing your lodging on account of your family s arriving no i only looked in i came to ask i thought that i should find zametov here oh yes of course you ve made friends i heard well no zametov is not here yes we ve lost zametov he s not been here since yesterday he quarrelled with everyone on leaving in the rudest way he is a feather headed youngster that s all one might have expected something from him but there you know what they are our brilliant young men he wanted to go in for some examination but it s only to talk and boast about it it will go no further than that of course it s a very different matter with you or mr razumihin there your friend your career is an intellectual one and you won t be deterred by failure for you one may say all the attractions of life nihil est you are an ascetic a monk a hermit a book a pen behind your ear a learned research that s where your spirit soars i am the same way myself have you read livingstone s travels no oh i have there are a great many nihilists about nowadays you know and indeed it is not to be wondered at what sort of days are they i ask you but we thought you are not a nihilist of course answer me openly openly n no believe me you can speak openly to me as you would to yourself official duty is one thing but you are thinking i meant to say friendship is quite another no you re wrong it s not friendship but the feeling of a man and a citizen the feeling of humanity and of love for the almighty i may be an official but i am always bound to feel myself a man and a citizen you were asking about zametov zametov will make a scandal in the french style in a house of bad reputation over a glass of champagne that s all your zametov is good for while i m perhaps so to speak burning with devotion and lofty feelings and besides i have rank consequence a post i am married and have children i fulfil the duties of a man and a citizen but who is he may i ask i appeal to you as a man ennobled by education then these midwives too have become extraordinarily numerous raskolnikov raised his eyebrows inquiringly the words of ilya petrovitch who had obviously been dining were for the most part a stream of empty sounds for him but some of them he understood he looked at him inquiringly not knowing how it would end i mean those crop headed wenches the talkative ilya petrovitch continued midwives is my name for them i think it a very satisfactory one ha ha they go to the academy study anatomy if i fall ill am i to send for a young lady to treat me what do you say ha ha ilya petrovitch laughed quite pleased with his own wit it s an immoderate zeal for education but once you re educated that s enough why abuse it why insult honourable people as that scoundrel zametov does why did he insult me i ask you look at these suicides too how common they are you can t fancy people spend their last halfpenny and kill themselves boys and girls and old people only this morning we heard about a gentleman who had just come to town nil pavlitch i say what was the name of that gentleman who shot himself svidrigailov someone answered from the other room with drowsy listlessness raskolnikov started svidrigailov svidrigailov has shot himself he cried what do you know svidrigailov yes i knew him he hadn t been here long yes that s so he had lost his wife was a man of reckless habits and all of a sudden shot himself and in such a shocking way he left in his notebook a few words that he dies in full possession of his faculties and that no one is to blame for his death he had money they say how did you come to know him i was acquainted my sister was governess in his family bah bah bah then no doubt you can tell us something about him you had no suspicion i saw him yesterday he was drinking wine i knew nothing raskolnikov felt as though something had fallen on him and was stifling him you ve turned pale again it s so stuffy here yes i must go muttered raskolnikov excuse my troubling you oh not at all as often as you like it s a pleasure to see you and i am glad to say so ilya petrovitch held out his hand i only wanted i came to see zametov i understand i understand and it s a pleasure to see you i am very glad good bye raskolnikov smiled he went out he reeled he was overtaken with giddiness and did not know what he was doing he began going down the stairs supporting himself with his right hand against the wall he fancied that a porter pushed past him on his way upstairs to the police office that a dog in the lower storey kept up a shrill barking and that a woman flung a rolling pin at it and shouted he went down and out into the yard there not far from the entrance stood sonia pale and horror stricken she looked wildly at him he stood still before her there was a look of poignant agony of despair in her face she clasped her hands his lips worked in an ugly meaningless smile he stood still a minute grinned and went back to the police office ilya petrovitch had sat down and was rummaging among some papers before him stood the same peasant who had pushed by on the stairs hulloa back again have you left something behind what s the matter raskolnikov with white lips and staring eyes came slowly nearer he walked right to the table leaned his hand on it tried to say something but could not only incoherent sounds were audible you are feeling ill a chair here sit down some water raskolnikov dropped on to a chair but he kept his eyes fixed on the face of ilya petrovitch which expressed unpleasant surprise both looked at one another for a minute and waited water was brought it was i began raskolnikov drink some water raskolnikov refused the water with his hand and softly and brokenly but distinctly said it was i killed the old pawnbroker woman and her sister lizaveta with an axe and robbed them ilya petrovitch opened his mouth people ran up on all sides raskolnikov repeated his statement epilogue i siberia on the banks of a broad solitary river stands a town one of the administrative centres of russia in the town there is a fortress in the fortress there is a prison in the prison the second class convict rodion raskolnikov has been confined for nine months almost a year and a half has passed since his crime there had been little difficulty about his trial the criminal adhered exactly firmly and clearly to his statement he did not confuse nor misrepresent the facts nor soften them in his own interest nor omit the smallest detail he explained every incident of the murder the secret of the pledge the piece of wood with a strip of metal which was found in the murdered woman s hand he described minutely how he had taken her keys what they were like as well as the chest and its contents he explained the mystery of lizaveta s murder described how koch and after him the student knocked and repeated all they had said to one another how he afterwards had run downstairs and heard nikolay and dmitri shouting how he had hidden in the empty flat and afterwards gone home he ended by indicating the stone in the yard off the voznesensky prospect under which the purse and the trinkets were found the whole thing in fact was perfectly clear the lawyers and the judges were very much struck among other things by the fact that he had hidden the trinkets and the purse under a stone without making use of them and that what was more he did not now remember what the trinkets were like or even how many there were the fact that he had never opened the purse and did not even know how much was in it seemed incredible there turned out to be in the purse three hundred and seventeen roubles and sixty copecks from being so long under the stone some of the most valuable notes lying uppermost had suffered from the damp they were a long while trying to discover why the accused man should tell a lie about this when about everything else he had made a truthful and straightforward confession finally some of the lawyers more versed in psychology admitted that it was possible he had really not looked into the purse and so didn t know what was in it when he hid it under the stone but they immediately drew the deduction that the crime could only have been committed through temporary mental derangement through homicidal mania without object or the pursuit of gain this fell in with the most recent fashionable theory of temporary insanity so often applied in our days in criminal cases moreover raskolnikov s hypochondriacal condition was proved by many witnesses by dr zossimov his former fellow students his landlady and her servant all this pointed strongly to the conclusion that raskolnikov was not quite like an ordinary murderer and robber but that there was another element in the case to the intense annoyance of those who maintained this opinion the criminal scarcely attempted to defend himself to the decisive question as to what motive impelled him to the murder and the robbery he answered very clearly with the coarsest frankness that the cause was his miserable position his poverty and helplessness and his desire to provide for his first steps in life by the help of the three thousand roubles he had reckoned on finding he had been led to the murder through his shallow and cowardly nature exasperated moreover by privation and failure to the question what led him to confess he answered that it was his heartfelt repentance all this was almost coarse the sentence however was more merciful than could have been expected perhaps partly because the criminal had not tried to justify himself but had rather shown a desire to exaggerate his guilt all the strange and peculiar circumstances of the crime were taken into consideration there could be no doubt of the abnormal and poverty stricken condition of the criminal at the time the fact that he had made no use of what he had stolen was put down partly to the effect of remorse partly to his abnormal mental condition at the time of the crime incidentally the murder of lizaveta served indeed to confirm the last hypothesis a man commits two murders and forgets that the door is open finally the confession at the very moment when the case was hopelessly muddled by the false evidence given by nikolay through melancholy and fanaticism and when moreover there were no proofs against the real criminal no suspicions even porfiry petrovitch fully kept his word all this did much to soften the sentence other circumstances too in the prisoner s favour came out quite unexpectedly razumihin somehow discovered and proved that while raskolnikov was at the university he had helped a poor consumptive fellow student and had spent his last penny on supporting him for six months and when this student died leaving a decrepit old father whom he had maintained almost from his thirteenth year raskolnikov had got the old man into a hospital and paid for his funeral when he died raskolnikov s landlady bore witness too that when they had lived in another house at five corners raskolnikov had rescued two little children from a house on fire and was burnt in doing so this was investigated and fairly well confirmed by many witnesses these facts made an impression in his favour and in the end the criminal was in consideration of extenuating circumstances condemned to penal servitude in the second class for a term of eight years only at the very beginning of the trial raskolnikov s mother fell ill dounia and razumihin found it possible to get her out of petersburg during the trial razumihin chose a town on the railway not far from petersburg so as to be able to follow every step of the trial and at the same time to see avdotya romanovna as often as possible pulcheria alexandrovna s illness was a strange nervous one and was accompanied by a partial derangement of her intellect when dounia returned from her last interview with her brother she had found her mother already ill in feverish delirium that evening razumihin and she agreed what answers they must make to her mother s questions about raskolnikov and made up a complete story for her mother s benefit of his having to go away to a distant part of russia on a business commission which would bring him in the end money and reputation but they were struck by the fact that pulcheria alexandrovna never asked them anything on the subject neither then nor thereafter on the contrary she had her own version of her son s sudden departure she told them with tears how he had come to say good bye to her hinting that she alone knew many mysterious and important facts and that rodya had many very powerful enemies so that it was necessary for him to be in hiding as for his future career she had no doubt that it would be brilliant when certain sinister influences could be removed she assured razumihin that her son would be one day a great statesman that his article and brilliant literary talent proved it this article she was continually reading she even read it aloud almost took it to bed with her but scarcely asked where rodya was though the subject was obviously avoided by the others which might have been enough to awaken her suspicions they began to be frightened at last at pulcheria alexandrovna s strange silence on certain subjects she did not for instance complain of getting no letters from him though in previous years she had only lived on the hope of letters from her beloved rodya this was the cause of great uneasiness to dounia the idea occurred to her that her mother suspected that there was something terrible in her son s fate and was afraid to ask for fear of hearing something still more awful in any case dounia saw clearly that her mother was not in full possession of her faculties it happened once or twice however that pulcheria alexandrovna gave such a turn to the conversation that it was impossible to answer her without mentioning where rodya was and on receiving unsatisfactory and suspicious answers she became at once gloomy and silent and this mood lasted for a long time dounia saw at last that it was hard to deceive her and came to the conclusion that it was better to be absolutely silent on certain points but it became more and more evident that the poor mother suspected something terrible dounia remembered her brother s telling her that her mother had overheard her talking in her sleep on the night after her interview with svidrigailov and before the fatal day of the confession had not she made out something from that sometimes days and even weeks of gloomy silence and tears would be succeeded by a period of hysterical animation and the invalid would begin to talk almost incessantly of her son of her hopes of his future her fancies were sometimes very strange they humoured her pretended to agree with her she saw perhaps that they were pretending but she still went on talking five months after raskolnikov s confession he was sentenced razumihin and sonia saw him in prison as often as it was possible at last the moment of separation came dounia swore to her brother that the separation should not be for ever razumihin did the same razumihin in his youthful ardour had firmly resolved to lay the foundations at least of a secure livelihood during the next three or four years and saving up a certain sum to emigrate to siberia a country rich in every natural resource and in need of workers active men and capital there they would settle in the town where rodya was and all together would begin a new life they all wept at parting raskolnikov had been very dreamy for a few days before he asked a great deal about his mother and was constantly anxious about her he worried so much about her that it alarmed dounia when he heard about his mother s illness he became very gloomy with sonia he was particularly reserved all the time with the help of the money left to her by svidrigailov sonia had long ago made her preparations to follow the party of convicts in which he was despatched to siberia not a word passed between raskolnikov and her on the subject but both knew it would be so at the final leave taking he smiled strangely at his sister s and razumihin s fervent anticipations of their happy future together when he should come out of prison he predicted that their mother s illness would soon have a fatal ending sonia and he at last set off two months later dounia was married to razumihin it was a quiet and sorrowful wedding porfiry petrovitch and zossimov were invited however during all this period razumihin wore an air of resolute determination dounia put implicit faith in his carrying out his plans and indeed she could not but believe in him he displayed a rare strength of will among other things he began attending university lectures again in order to take his degree they were continually making plans for the future both counted on settling in siberia within five years at least till then they rested their hopes on sonia pulcheria alexandrovna was delighted to give her blessing to dounia s marriage with razumihin but after the marriage she became even more melancholy and anxious to give her pleasure razumihin told her how raskolnikov had looked after the poor student and his decrepit father and how a year ago he had been burnt and injured in rescuing two little children from a fire these two pieces of news excited pulcheria alexandrovna s disordered imagination almost to ecstasy she was continually talking about them even entering into conversation with strangers in the street though dounia always accompanied her in public conveyances and shops wherever she could capture a listener she would begin the discourse about her son his article how he had helped the student how he had been burnt at the fire and so on dounia did not know how to restrain her apart from the danger of her morbid excitement there was the risk of someone s recalling raskolnikov s name and speaking of the recent trial pulcheria alexandrovna found out the address of the mother of the two children her son had saved and insisted on going to see her at last her restlessness reached an extreme point she would sometimes begin to cry suddenly and was often ill and feverishly delirious one morning she declared that by her reckoning rodya ought soon to be home that she remembered when he said good bye to her he said that they must expect him back in nine months she began to prepare for his coming began to do up her room for him to clean the furniture to wash and put up new hangings and so on dounia was anxious but said nothing and helped her to arrange the room after a fatiguing day spent in continual fancies in joyful day dreams and tears pulcheria alexandrovna was taken ill in the night and by morning she was feverish and delirious it was brain fever she died within a fortnight in her delirium she dropped words which showed that she knew a great deal more about her son s terrible fate than they had supposed for a long time raskolnikov did not know of his mother s death though a regular correspondence had been maintained from the time he reached siberia it was carried on by means of sonia who wrote every month to the razumihins and received an answer with unfailing regularity at first they found sonia s letters dry and unsatisfactory but later on they came to the conclusion that the letters could not be better for from these letters they received a complete picture of their unfortunate brother s life sonia s letters were full of the most matter of fact detail the simplest and clearest description of all raskolnikov s surroundings as a convict there was no word of her own hopes no conjecture as to the future no description of her feelings instead of any attempt to interpret his state of mind and inner life she gave the simple facts that is his own words an exact account of his health what he asked for at their interviews what commission he gave her and so on all these facts she gave with extraordinary minuteness the picture of their unhappy brother stood out at last with great clearness and precision there could be no mistake because nothing was given but facts but dounia and her husband could get little comfort out of the news especially at first sonia wrote that he was constantly sullen and not ready to talk that he scarcely seemed interested in the news she gave him from their letters that he sometimes asked after his mother and that when seeing that he had guessed the truth she told him at last of her death she was surprised to find that he did not seem greatly affected by it not externally at any rate she told them that although he seemed so wrapped up in himself and as it were shut himself off from everyone he took a very direct and simple view of his new life that he understood his position expected nothing better for the time had no ill founded hopes as is so common in his position and scarcely seemed surprised at anything in his surroundings so unlike anything he had known before she wrote that his health was satisfactory he did his work without shirking or seeking to do more he was almost indifferent about food but except on sundays and holidays the food was so bad that at last he had been glad to accept some money from her sonia to have his own tea every day he begged her not to trouble about anything else declaring that all this fuss about him only annoyed him sonia wrote further that in prison he shared the same room with the rest that she had not seen the inside of their barracks but concluded that they were crowded miserable and unhealthy that he slept on a plank bed with a rug under him and was unwilling to make any other arrangement but that he lived so poorly and roughly not from any plan or design but simply from inattention and indifference sonia wrote simply that he had at first shown no interest in her visits had almost been vexed with her indeed for coming unwilling to talk and rude to her but that in the end these visits had become a habit and almost a necessity for him so that he was positively distressed when she was ill for some days and could not visit him she used to see him on holidays at the prison gates or in the guard room to which he was brought for a few minutes to see her on working days she would go to see him at work either at the workshops or at the brick kilns or at the sheds on the banks of the irtish about herself sonia wrote that she had succeeded in making some acquaintances in the town that she did sewing and as there was scarcely a dressmaker in the town she was looked upon as an indispensable person in many houses but she did not mention that the authorities were through her interested in raskolnikov that his task was lightened and so on at last the news came dounia had indeed noticed signs of alarm and uneasiness in the preceding letters that he held aloof from everyone that his fellow prisoners did not like him that he kept silent for days at a time and was becoming very pale in the last letter sonia wrote that he had been taken very seriously ill and was in the convict ward of the hospital ii he was ill a long time but it was not the horrors of prison life not the hard labour the bad food the shaven head or the patched clothes that crushed him what did he care for all those trials and hardships he was even glad of the hard work physically exhausted he could at least reckon on a few hours of quiet sleep and what was the food to him the thin cabbage soup with beetles floating in it in the past as a student he had often not had even that his clothes were warm and suited to his manner of life he did not even feel the fetters was he ashamed of his shaven head and parti coloured coat before whom before sonia sonia was afraid of him how could he be ashamed before her and yet he was ashamed even before sonia whom he tortured because of it with his contemptuous rough manner but it was not his shaven head and his fetters he was ashamed of his pride had been stung to the quick it was wounded pride that made him ill oh how happy he would have been if he could have blamed himself he could have borne anything then even shame and disgrace but he judged himself severely and his exasperated conscience found no particularly terrible fault in his past except a simple blunder which might happen to anyone he was ashamed just because he raskolnikov had so hopelessly stupidly come to grief through some decree of blind fate and must humble himself and submit to the idiocy of a sentence if he were anyhow to be at peace vague and objectless anxiety in the present and in the future a continual sacrifice leading to nothing that was all that lay before him and what comfort was it to him that at the end of eight years he would only be thirty two and able to begin a new life what had he to live for what had he to look forward to why should he strive to live in order to exist why he had been ready a thousand times before to give up existence for the sake of an idea for a hope even for a fancy mere existence had always been too little for him he had always wanted more perhaps it was just because of the strength of his desires that he had thought himself a man to whom more was permissible than to others and if only fate would have sent him repentance burning repentance that would have torn his heart and robbed him of sleep that repentance the awful agony of which brings visions of hanging or drowning oh he would have been glad of it tears and agonies would at least have been life but he did not repent of his crime at least he might have found relief in raging at his stupidity as he had raged at the grotesque blunders that had brought him to prison but now in prison in freedom he thought over and criticised all his actions again and by no means found them so blundering and so grotesque as they had seemed at the fatal time in what way he asked himself was my theory stupider than others that have swarmed and clashed from the beginning of the world one has only to look at the thing quite independently broadly and uninfluenced by commonplace ideas and my idea will by no means seem so strange oh sceptics and halfpenny philosophers why do you halt half way why does my action strike them as so horrible he said to himself is it because it was a crime what is meant by crime my conscience is at rest of course it was a legal crime of course the letter of the law was broken and blood was shed well punish me for the letter of the law and that s enough of course in that case many of the benefactors of mankind who snatched power for themselves instead of inheriting it ought to have been punished at their first steps but those men succeeded and so they were right and i didn t and so i had no right to have taken that step it was only in that that he recognised his criminality only in the fact that he had been unsuccessful and had confessed it he suffered too from the question why had he not killed himself why had he stood looking at the river and preferred to confess was the desire to live so strong and was it so hard to overcome it had not svidrigailov overcome it although he was afraid of death in misery he asked himself this question and could not understand that at the very time he had been standing looking into the river he had perhaps been dimly conscious of the fundamental falsity in himself and his convictions he didn t understand that that consciousness might be the promise of a future crisis of a new view of life and of his future resurrection he preferred to attribute it to the dead weight of instinct which he could not step over again through weakness and meanness he looked at his fellow prisoners and was amazed to see how they all loved life and prized it it seemed to him that they loved and valued life more in prison than in freedom what terrible agonies and privations some of them the tramps for instance had endured could they care so much for a ray of sunshine for the primeval forest the cold spring hidden away in some unseen spot which the tramp had marked three years before and longed to see again as he might to see his sweetheart dreaming of the green grass round it and the bird singing in the bush as he went on he saw still more inexplicable examples in prison of course there was a great deal he did not see and did not want to see he lived as it were with downcast eyes it was loathsome and unbearable for him to look but in the end there was much that surprised him and he began as it were involuntarily to notice much that he had not suspected before what surprised him most of all was the terrible impossible gulf that lay between him and all the rest they seemed to be a different species and he looked at them and they at him with distrust and hostility he felt and knew the reasons of his isolation but he would never have admitted till then that those reasons were so deep and strong there were some polish exiles political prisoners among them they simply looked down upon all the rest as ignorant churls but raskolnikov could not look upon them like that he saw that these ignorant men were in many respects far wiser than the poles there were some russians who were just as contemptuous a former officer and two seminarists raskolnikov saw their mistake as clearly he was disliked and avoided by everyone they even began to hate him at last why he could not tell men who had been far more guilty despised and laughed at his crime you re a gentleman they used to say you shouldn t hack about with an axe that s not a gentleman s work the second week in lent his turn came to take the sacrament with his gang he went to church and prayed with the others a quarrel broke out one day he did not know how all fell on him at once in a fury you re an infidel you don t believe in god they shouted you ought to be killed he had never talked to them about god nor his belief but they wanted to kill him as an infidel he said nothing one of the prisoners rushed at him in a perfect frenzy raskolnikov awaited him calmly and silently his eyebrows did not quiver his face did not flinch the guard succeeded in intervening between him and his assailant or there would have been bloodshed there was another question he could not decide why were they all so fond of sonia she did not try to win their favour she rarely met them sometimes only she came to see him at work for a moment and yet everybody knew her they knew that she had come out to follow him knew how and where she lived she never gave them money did them no particular services only once at christmas she sent them all presents of pies and rolls but by degrees closer relations sprang up between them and sonia she would write and post letters for them to their relations relations of the prisoners who visited the town at their instructions left with sonia presents and money for them their wives and sweethearts knew her and used to visit her and when she visited raskolnikov at work or met a party of the prisoners on the road they all took off their hats to her little mother sofya semyonovna you are our dear good little mother coarse branded criminals said to that frail little creature she would smile and bow to them and everyone was delighted when she smiled they even admired her gait and turned round to watch her walking they admired her too for being so little and in fact did not know what to admire her most for they even came to her for help in their illnesses he was in the hospital from the middle of lent till after easter when he was better he remembered the dreams he had had while he was feverish and delirious he dreamt that the whole world was condemned to a terrible new strange plague that had come to europe from the depths of asia all were to be destroyed except a very few chosen some new sorts of microbes were attacking the bodies of men but these microbes were endowed with intelligence and will men attacked by them became at once mad and furious but never had men considered themselves so intellectual and so completely in possession of the truth as these sufferers never had they considered their decisions their scientific conclusions their moral convictions so infallible whole villages whole towns and peoples went mad from the infection all were excited and did not understand one another each thought that he alone had the truth and was wretched looking at the others beat himself on the breast wept and wrung his hands they did not know how to judge and could not agree what to consider evil and what good they did not know whom to blame whom to justify men killed each other in a sort of senseless spite they gathered together in armies against one another but even on the march the armies would begin attacking each other the ranks would be broken and the soldiers would fall on each other stabbing and cutting biting and devouring each other the alarm bell was ringing all day long in the towns men rushed together but why they were summoned and who was summoning them no one knew the most ordinary trades were abandoned because everyone proposed his own ideas his own improvements and they could not agree the land too was abandoned men met in groups agreed on something swore to keep together but at once began on something quite different from what they had proposed they accused one another fought and killed each other there were conflagrations and famine all men and all things were involved in destruction the plague spread and moved further and further only a few men could be saved in the whole world they were a pure chosen people destined to found a new race and a new life to renew and purify the earth but no one had seen these men no one had heard their words and their voices raskolnikov was worried that this senseless dream haunted his memory so miserably the impression of this feverish delirium persisted so long the second week after easter had come there were warm bright spring days in the prison ward the grating windows under which the sentinel paced were opened sonia had only been able to visit him twice during his illness each time she had to obtain permission and it was difficult but she often used to come to the hospital yard especially in the evening sometimes only to stand a minute and look up at the windows of the ward one evening when he was almost well again raskolnikov fell asleep on waking up he chanced to go to the window and at once saw sonia in the distance at the hospital gate she seemed to be waiting for someone something stabbed him to the heart at that minute he shuddered and moved away from the window next day sonia did not come nor the day after he noticed that he was expecting her uneasily at last he was discharged on reaching the prison he learnt from the convicts that sofya semyonovna was lying ill at home and was unable to go out he was very uneasy and sent to inquire after her he soon learnt that her illness was not dangerous hearing that he was anxious about her sonia sent him a pencilled note telling him that she was much better that she had a slight cold and that she would soon very soon come and see him at his work his heart throbbed painfully as he read it again it was a warm bright day early in the morning at six o clock he went off to work on the river bank where they used to pound alabaster and where there was a kiln for baking it in a shed there were only three of them sent one of the convicts went with the guard to the fortress to fetch a tool the other began getting the wood ready and laying it in the kiln raskolnikov came out of the shed on to the river bank sat down on a heap of logs by the shed and began gazing at the wide deserted river from the high bank a broad landscape opened before him the sound of singing floated faintly audible from the other bank in the vast steppe bathed in sunshine he could just see like black specks the nomads tents there there was freedom there other men were living utterly unlike those here there time itself seemed to stand still as though the age of abraham and his flocks had not passed raskolnikov sat gazing his thoughts passed into day dreams into contemplation he thought of nothing but a vague restlessness excited and troubled him suddenly he found sonia beside him she had come up noiselessly and sat down at his side it was still quite early the morning chill was still keen she wore her poor old burnous and the green shawl her face still showed signs of illness it was thinner and paler she gave him a joyful smile of welcome but held out her hand with her usual timidity she was always timid of holding out her hand to him and sometimes did not offer it at all as though afraid he would repel it he always took her hand as though with repugnance always seemed vexed to meet her and was sometimes obstinately silent throughout her visit sometimes she trembled before him and went away deeply grieved but now their hands did not part he stole a rapid glance at her and dropped his eyes on the ground without speaking they were alone no one had seen them the guard had turned away for the time how it happened he did not know but all at once something seemed to seize him and fling him at her feet he wept and threw his arms round her knees for the first instant she was terribly frightened and she turned pale she jumped up and looked at him trembling but at the same moment she understood and a light of infinite happiness came into her eyes she knew and had no doubt that he loved her beyond everything and that at last the moment had come they wanted to speak but could not tears stood in their eyes they were both pale and thin but those sick pale faces were bright with the dawn of a new future of a full resurrection into a new life they were renewed by love the heart of each held infinite sources of life for the heart of the other they resolved to wait and be patient they had another seven years to wait and what terrible suffering and what infinite happiness before them but he had risen again and he knew it and felt it in all his being while she she only lived in his life on the evening of the same day when the barracks were locked raskolnikov lay on his plank bed and thought of her he had even fancied that day that all the convicts who had been his enemies looked at him differently he had even entered into talk with them and they answered him in a friendly way he remembered that now and thought it was bound to be so wasn t everything now bound to be changed he thought of her he remembered how continually he had tormented her and wounded her heart he remembered her pale and thin little face but these recollections scarcely troubled him now he knew with what infinite love he would now repay all her sufferings and what were all all the agonies of the past everything even his crime his sentence and imprisonment seemed to him now in the first rush of feeling an external strange fact with which he had no concern but he could not think for long together of anything that evening and he could not have analysed anything consciously he was simply feeling life had stepped into the place of theory and something quite different would work itself out in his mind under his pillow lay the new testament he took it up mechanically the book belonged to sonia it was the one from which she had read the raising of lazarus to him at first he was afraid that she would worry him about religion would talk about the gospel and pester him with books but to his great surprise she had not once approached the subject and had not even offered him the testament he had asked her for it himself not long before his illness and she brought him the book without a word till now he had not opened it he did not open it now but one thought passed through his mind can her convictions not be mine now her feelings her aspirations at least she too had been greatly agitated that day and at night she was taken ill again but she was so happy and so unexpectedly happy that she was almost frightened of her happiness seven years only seven years at the beginning of their happiness at some moments they were both ready to look on those seven years as though they were seven days he did not know that the new life would not be given him for nothing that he would have to pay dearly for it that it would cost him great striving great suffering but that is the beginning of a new story the story of the gradual renewal of a man the story of his gradual regeneration of his passing from one world into another of his initiation into a new unknown life that might be the subject of a new story but our present story is ended
